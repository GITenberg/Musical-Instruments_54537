<p><i>These Handbooks are reprints of the dissertations prefixed to
the large catalogues of the chief divisions of works of art in the
Museum at South Kensington; arranged and so far abridged as
to bring each into a portable shape. The Lords of the Committee
of Council on Education having determined on the publication of
them, the editor trusts that they will meet the purpose intended;
namely, to be useful, not alone for the collections at South Kensington
but for other collections, by enabling the public at a
trifling cost to understand something of the history and character
of the subjects treated of.</i></p>

<p><i>The authorities referred to in each book are given in the large
catalogues; where will also be found detailed descriptions of the
very numerous examples in the South Kensington Museum.</i></p>

<p class="ph1">MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>Music, in however primitive a stage of development it may be
with some nations, is universally appreciated as one of the Fine
Arts. The origin of vocal music may have been coeval with that
of language; and the construction of musical instruments evidently
dates with the earliest inventions which suggested themselves to
human ingenuity. There exist even at the present day some savage
tribes in Australia and South America who, although they have
no more than the five first numerals in their language and are
thereby unable to count the fingers of both hands together, nevertheless
possess musical instruments of their own contrivance, with
which they accompany their songs and dances.</p>

<p>Wood, metal, and the hide of animals, are the most common
substances used in the construction of musical instruments. In
tropical countries bamboo or some similar kind of cane and gourds
are especially made use of for this purpose. The ingenuity of man
has contrived to employ in producing music, horn, bone, glass,
pottery, slabs of sonorous stone,&mdash;in fact, almost all vibrating
matter. The strings of instruments have been made of the
hair of animals, of silk, the runners of creeping plants, the fibrous
roots of certain trees, of cane, catgut (which absurdly referred
to the cat, is from the sheep, goat, lamb, camel, and some other
animals), metal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The mode in which individual nations or tribes are in the habit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
of embellishing their musical instruments is sometimes as characteristic
as it is singular. The negroes in several districts of western
Africa affix to their drums human skulls. A war-trumpet of the
king of Ashantee which was brought to England is surrounded
by human jawbones. The Maories in New Zealand carve around
the mouth-hole of their trumpets a figure intended, it is said, to
represent female lips. The materials for ornamentation chiefly
employed by savages are bright colours, beads, shells, grasses, the
bark of trees, feathers, stones, gilding, pieces of looking-glass
inlaid like mosaic, &amp;c. Uncivilized nations are sure to consider
anything which is bright and glittering ornamental, especially if it
is also scarce. Captain Tuckey saw in Congo a negro instrument
which was ornamented with part of the broken frame of a looking-glass,
to which were affixed in a semicircle a number of brass
buttons with the head of Louis XVI. on them,&mdash;perhaps a relic of
some French sailor drowned near the coast years ago.</p>

<p>Again, musical instruments are not unfrequently formed in the
shape of certain animals. Thus, a kind of harmonicon of the
Chinese represents the figure of a crouching tiger. The Burmese
possess a stringed instrument in the shape of an alligator. Even
more grotesque are the imitations of various beasts adopted by the
Javanese. The natives of New Guinea have a singularly shaped
drum, terminating in the head of a reptile. A wooden rattle like
a bird is a favourite instrument of the Indians of Nootka Sound.
In short, not only the inner construction of the instruments and
their peculiar quality of sound exhibit in most nations certain
distinctive characteristics, but it is also in great measure true as
to their outward appearance.</p>

<p>An arrangement of the various kinds of musical instruments in
a regular order, beginning with that kind which is the most universally
known and progressing gradually to the least usual, gives
the following results. Instruments of percussion of indefinite
sonorousness or, in other words, pulsatile instruments which have
not a sound of a fixed pitch, as the drum, rattle, castanets, &amp;c.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
are most universal. Wind instruments of the flute kind,&mdash;including
pipes, whistles, flutes, Pandean pipes, &amp;c.&mdash;are also to be found
almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Much the same is the case with wind instruments of the trumpet
kind. These are often made of the horns, bones, and tusks of
animals; frequently of vegetable substances and of metal. Instruments
of percussion of definite sonorousness are chiefly met with
in China, Japan, Burmah, Siam, and Java. They not unfrequently
contain a series of tones produced by slabs of wood or metal,
which are beaten with a sort of hammer, as our harmonicon is
played.</p>

<p>Stringed instruments without a finger board, or any similar contrivance
which enables the performer to produce a number of
different tones on one string, are generally found among nations
whose musical accomplishments have emerged from the earliest
state of infancy. The strings are twanged with the fingers or with
a piece of wood, horn, metal, or any other suitable substance
serving as a <i>plectrum</i>; or are made to vibrate by being beaten
with a hammer, as our dulcimer. Stringed instruments provided
with a finger-board on which different tones are producible on one
string by the performer shortening it more or less,&mdash;as on the
guitar and violin,&mdash;are met with almost exclusively among nations
in a somewhat advanced stage of musical progress. Such as are
played with a bow are the least common; they are, however,
known to the Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Persians, Arabs, and a
few other nations, besides those of Europe and their descendants
in other countries.</p>

<p>Wind instruments of the organ kind,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, such as are constructed
of a number of tubes which can be sounded together by
means of a common mouthpiece or some similar contrivance, and
upon which therefore chords and combinations of chords, or
harmony, can be produced,&mdash;are comparatively of rare occurrence.
Some interesting specimens of them exist in China, Japan, Laos,
and Siam.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Besides these various kinds of sound-producing means employed
in musical performances, a few others less widely diffused could
be pointed out, which are of a construction not represented in any
of our well-known European specimens. For instance, some
nations have peculiar instruments of friction, which can hardly be
classed with our instruments of percussion. Again, there are contrivances
in which a number of strings are caused to vibrate by a
current of air, much as is the case with the &AElig;olian harp; which
might with equal propriety be considered either as stringed instruments
or as wind instruments. In short, our usual classification of
all the various species into three distinct divisions, viz. <i>Stringed
Instruments</i>, <i>Wind Instruments</i>, and <i>Instruments of Percussion</i>, is
not tenable if we extend our researches over the whole globe.</p>

<p>The collection at South Kensington contains several foreign
instruments which cannot fail to prove interesting to the musician.
Recent investigations have more and more elicited the fact that
the music of every nation exhibits some distinctive characteristics
which may afford valuable hints to a composer or performer. A
familiarity with the popular songs of different countries is advisable
on account of the remarkable originality of the airs: these mostly
spring from the heart. Hence the natural and true expression, the
delightful health and vigour by which they are generally distinguished.
Our more artificial compositions are, on the other hand,
not unfrequently deficient in these charms, because they often
emanate from the fingers or the pen rather than from the heart.
Howbeit, the predominance of expressive melody and effective
rhythm over harmonious combinations, so usual in the popular
compositions of various nations, would alone suffice to recommend
them to the careful attention of our modern musicians. The same
may be said with regard to the surprising variety in construction
and in manner of expression prevailing in the popular songs
and dance-tunes of different countries. Indeed, every nation’s
musical effusions exhibit a character peculiarly their own, with which
the musician would find it advantageous to familiarize himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>Now, it will easily be understood that an acquaintance with the
musical instruments of a nation conveys a more correct idea than
could otherwise be obtained of the characteristic features of the
nation’s musical compositions. Furthermore, in many instances
the construction of the instruments reveals to us the nature of the
musical intervals, scales, modulations, and suchlike noteworthy
facts. True, inquiries like these have hitherto not received from
musicians the attention which they deserve. The adepts in most
other arts are in this respect in advance. They are convinced that
useful information may be gathered by investigating the productions
even of uncivilized nations, and by thus tracing the gradual
progress of an art from its primitive infancy to its highest degree
of development.</p>

<p>Again, from an examination of the musical instruments of
foreign nations we may derive valuable hints for the improvement
of our own; or even for the invention of new. Several
principles of construction have thus been adopted by us from
eastern nations. For instance, the <i>free reed</i> used in the harmonium
is an importation from China. The organ builder Kratzenstein,
who lived in St. Petersburg during the reign of Catharine II.,
happened to see the Chinese instrument <i>cheng</i>, which is of this
construction, and it suggested to him, about the end of the last
century, to apply the <i>free reed</i> to certain organ stops. At the present
day instruments of the harmonium class have become such
universal favourites in western Europe as almost to compete with
the pianoforte.</p>

<p>Several other well-authenticated instances could be cited in
which one instrument has suggested the construction of another
of a superior kind. The prototype of our pianoforte was evidently
the dulcimer, known at an early time to the Arabs and Persians
who call it <i>santir</i>. One of the old names given to the dulcimer
by European nations is <i>cimbal</i>. The Poles at the present day
call it <i>cymbaly</i>, and the Magyars in Hungary <i>cimbalom</i>. The
<i>clavicembalo</i>, the predecessor of the pianoforte, was in fact nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
but a <i>cembalo</i> with a key-board attached to it; and some of the
old <i>clavicembali</i>, still preserved, exhibit the trapezium shape, the
round hole in the middle of the sound-board, and other peculiarities
of the first dulcimer. Again, the gradual development of
the dulcimer from a rude contrivance, consisting merely of a
wooden board across which a few strings are stretched, is distinctly
traceable by a reference to the musical instruments of
nations in different stages of civilization. The same is the case
with our highly perfected harp, of which curious specimens, representing
the instrument in its most primitive condition, are still to
be found among several barbarous tribes. We might perhaps
infer from its shape that it originally consisted of nothing more
than an elastic stick bent by a string. The Damaras, a native
tribe of South-western Africa, actually use their bow occasionally
as a musical instrument, when they are not engaged in war or in
the chase. They tighten the string nearly in the middle by means
of a leathern thong, whereby they obtain two distinct sounds,
which, for want of a sound-board, are of course very weak and
scarcely audible to anyone but the performer. Some neighbouring
tribes, however, possess a musical instrument very similar in
appearance to the bow, to which they attach a gourd, hollowed
and open at the top, which serves as a sound-board. Again, other
African tribes have a similar instrument, superior in construction
only inasmuch as it contains more than one string, and is provided
with a sound-board consisting of a suitable piece of
sonorous wood. In short, the more improved we find these
contrivances the closer they approach our harp. And it could be
shown if this were requisite for our present purpose that much
the same gradual progress towards perfection, which we observe
in the African harp, is traceable in the harps of several nations in
different parts of the world.</p>

<p>Moreover, a collection of musical instruments deserves the
attention of the ethnologist as much as of the musician. Indeed,
this may be asserted of national music in general; for it gives us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
an insight into the heart of man, reveals to us the feelings and
predilections of different races on the globe, and affords us a clue
to the natural affinity which exists between different families of
men. Again, a collection must prove interesting in a historical
point of view. Scholars will find among old instruments specimens
which were in common use in England at the time of queen Elizabeth,
and which are not unfrequently mentioned in the literature
of that period. In many instances the passages in which allusion
is made to them can hardly be understood, if we are unacquainted
with the shape and construction of the instruments. Furthermore,
these relics of bygone times bring before our eyes the manners
and customs of our forefathers, and assist us in understanding
them correctly.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the modification which our orchestra has
undergone, in the course of scarcely more than a century, is great
indeed. Most of the instruments which were highly popular about
a hundred years ago have either fallen into disuse or are now so
much altered that they may almost be considered as new inventions.
Among Asiatic nations, on the other hand, we meet with
several instruments which have retained unchanged through many
centuries their old construction and outward appearance. At
South Kensington may be seen instruments still in use in Egypt
and western Asia, precisely like specimens represented on monuments
dating from a period of three thousand years ago. By a
reference to the eastern instruments of the present time we obtain
therefore a key for investigating the earlier Egyptian and Assyrian
representations of musical performances; and, likewise, for appreciating
more exactly the biblical records respecting the music of
the Hebrews. Perhaps these evidences will convey to some
inquirers a less high opinion than they have hitherto entertained,
regarding the musical accomplishments of the Hebrew bands in
the solemn processions of king David or in Solomon’s temple;
but the opinion will be all the nearer to the truth.</p>

<p>There is another point of interest about such collections, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
especially that at South Kensington, which must not be left
unnoticed. Several instruments are remarkable on account of
their elegant shape and tasteful ornamentation. This is particularly
the case with some specimens from Asiatic countries.
The beautiful designs with which they are embellished may afford
valuable patterns for study and for adoption in works of art.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>A really complete account of all the musical instruments from
the earliest time known to us would require much more space than
can here be afforded. We can attempt only a concise historical
survey. We venture to hope that the illustrations interspersed
throughout the text will to the intelligent reader elucidate many
facts which, for the reason stated, are touched upon but cursorily.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pre-historic Relics.</span></h3>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i009" src="images/i009.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A musical relic has recently been exhumed in the department
of Dordogne in France, which was constructed in an age when
the fauna of France included the reindeer, the rhinoceros, and the
mammoth, the hy&aelig;na, the bear, and the cave-lion. It is a small
bone somewhat less than two inches in length, in which is a hole,
evidently bored by means
of one of the little flint
knives which men used
before acquaintance with
the employment of metal
for tools and weapons.
Many of these flints were found in the same place with the bones.
Only about half a dozen of the bones, of which a considerable
number have been exhumed, possess the artificial hole. We
give a woodcut of one of them.</p>

<p>M. Lartet surmises the perforated bone to have been used as a
whistle in hunting animals. It is the first digital phalanx of a
ruminant, drilled to a certain depth by a smooth cylindrical bore
on its lower surface near the expanded upper articulation. On
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
applying it to the lower lip and blowing into it a shrill sound is
yielded. Three of these phalanges are of reindeer, one is of
Chamois. Again, among the relics which have been brought to
light from the cave of Lombrive, in the department of Ari&egrave;ge,
occur several eye-teeth of the dog which have a hole drilled into
them near the root. Probably they also yield sounds like those
reindeer bones, or like the tube of a key. Another whistle&mdash;or
rather a pipe, for it has three finger-holes by means of which
different tones could be produced&mdash;was found in a burying-place,
dating from the stone period, in the vicinity of Poitiers in France:
it is rudely constructed from a fragment of stag’s-horn. It is
blown at the end, like a <i>fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec</i> and the three finger-holes are
placed equidistantly. Four distinct tones must have been easily
obtainable on it: the lowest, when all the finger-holes were
covered; the other three, by opening the finger-holes successively.
From the character of the stone utensils and weapons discovered
with this pipe it is conjectured that the burying-place from which
it was exhumed dates from the latest time of the stone age.
Therefore, however old it may be, it is a more recent contrivance
than the reindeer-bone whistle from the cavern of the Dordogne.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ancient Egyptians.</span></h3>

<p>The most ancient nations historically known possessed musical
instruments which, though in acoustic construction greatly inferior
to our own, exhibit a degree of perfection which could have been
attained only after a long period of cultivation. Many tribes of
the present day have not yet reached this stage of musical progress.</p>

<p>As regards the instruments of the ancient Egyptians we now
possess perhaps more detailed information than of those appertaining
to any other nation of antiquity. This information we
owe especially to the exactness with which the instruments are
depicted in sculptures and paintings. Whoever has examined
these interesting monuments with even ordinary care cannot but
be convinced that the representations which they exhibit are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
faithful transcripts from life. Moreover, if there remained any
doubt respecting the accuracy of the representations of the musical
instruments it might be dispelled by existing evidence. Several
specimens have been discovered in tombs preserved in a more
or less perfect condition.</p>

<p>The Egyptians possessed various kinds of harps, some of which
were elegantly shaped and tastefully ornamented. The largest
were about six and a half feet high; and the small ones frequently
had some sort of stand which enabled the performer to play upon
the instrument while standing. The name of the harp was <i>buni</i>.
Its frame had no front pillar; the tension of the strings therefore
cannot have been anything like so strong as on our present harp.</p>

<p>The Egyptian harps most remarkable for elegance of form and
elaborate decoration are the two which were first noticed by
Bruce, who found them painted in fresco on the wall of a sepulchre
at Thebes, supposed to be the tomb of Rameses III. who reigned
about 1250 <small>B.C.</small> Bruce’s discovery created sensation among the
musicians. The fact that at so remote an age the Egyptians
should have possessed harps which vie with our own in elegance
and beauty of form appeared to some so incredible that the
correctness of Bruce’s representations, as engraved in his “Travels,”
was greatly doubted. Sketches of the same harps, taken subsequently
and at different times from the frescoes, have since been
published, but they differ more or less from each other in appearance
and in the number of strings. A kind of triangular harp of
the Egyptians was discovered in a well-preserved condition and
is now deposited in the Louvre. It has twenty-one strings; a
greater number than is generally represented on the monuments.
All these instruments, however much they differed from each
other in form, had one peculiarity in common, namely the
absence of the fore pillar.</p>

<p>The <i>nofre</i>, a kind of guitar, was almost identical in construction
with the Tamboura at the present day in use among several
eastern nations. It was evidently a great favourite with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
ancient Egyptians. A figure of it is found among their hieroglyphs,
signifying “good.” It occurs in representations of concerts
dating earlier than from <small>B.C.</small> 1500. The <i>nofre</i> affords the
best proof that the Egyptians had made considerable progress in
music at a very early age; since it shows that they understood
how to produce on a few strings, by means of the finger-board,
a greater number of notes than were obtainable even on their
harps. The instrument had two or four strings, was played with
a plectrum and appears to have been sometimes, if not always,
provided with frets. In the British museum is a fragment of a
fresco obtained from a tomb at Thebes, on which two female
performers on the <i>nofre</i> are represented. The painter has distinctly
indicated the frets.</p>

<p>Small pipes of the Egyptians have been discovered, made of
reed, with three, four, five, or more finger-holes. There are some
interesting examples in the British museum; one of which has
seven holes burnt in at the side. Two straws were found with it
of nearly the same length as the pipe, which is about one foot
long. In some other pipes pieces of a kind of thick straw have
also been found inserted into the tube, obviously serving for a
similar purpose as the <i>reed</i> in our oboe or clarionet.</p>

<p>The <i>s&ecirc;bi</i>, a single flute, was of considerable length, and the
performer appears to have been obliged to extend his arms almost
at full length in order to reach the furthest finger-hole. As <i>s&ecirc;bi</i>
is also the name of the leg-bone (like the Latin <i>tibia</i>) it may be
supposed that the Egyptian flute was originally made of bone.
Those, however, which have been found are of wood or reed.</p>

<p>A flute-concert is painted on one of the tombs in the pyramids
of Gizeh and dates, according to Lepsius, from an age earlier
than <small>B.C.</small> 2000. Eight musicians (as seen in the woodcut) are
performing on flutes. Three of them, one behind the other, are
kneeling and holding their flutes in exactly the same manner.
Facing these are three others, in a precisely similar position.
A seventh is sitting on the ground to the left of the six,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
with his back turned towards
them, but also in the act of
blowing his flute, like the
others. An eighth is standing
at the right side of the group
with his face turned towards
them, holding his flute before
him with both hands, as if he
were going to put it to his
mouth, or had just left off
playing. He is clothed, while
the others have only a narrow
girdle round their loins. Perhaps
he is the director of this
singular band, or the <i>solo</i> performer
who is waiting for the
termination of the <i>tutti</i> before
renewing his part of the performance.
The division of
the players into two sets,
facing each other, suggests
the possibility that the instruments
were classed somewhat
like the first and second violins,
or the <i>flauto primo</i> and
<i>flauto secondo</i> of our orchestras.
The occasional employment
of the interval of the
third, or the fifth, as accompaniment
to the melody, is
not unusual even with nations
less advanced in music
than were the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i013" src="images/i013.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></div>

<p>The Double-Pipe, called <i>mam</i>, appears to have been a very
popular instrument, if we judge from the frequency of its occurrence
in the representations of musical performances. Furthermore,
the Egyptians had, as far as is known to us, two kinds of
trumpets; three kinds of tambourines, or little hand drums;
three kinds of drums, chiefly barrel-shaped; and various kinds of
gongs, bells, cymbals, and castanets. The trumpet appears to
have been usually of brass. A peculiar wind-instrument, somewhat
the shape of a champagne bottle and perhaps made of
pottery or wood, occurs only once in the representations transmitted
to us.</p>

<p>The Egyptian drum was from two to three feet in length,
covered with parchment at both ends and braced by cords. The
performer carried it before him, generally by means of a band
over his shoulder, while he was beating it with his hands on both
ends. Of another kind of drum an actual specimen has been
found in the excavations made in the year 1823 at Thebes. It
was 1&frac12; feet high and 2 feet broad, and had cords for bracing it.
A piece of catgut encircled each end of the drum, being wound
round each cord, by means of which the cords could be tightened
or slackened at pleasure by pushing the two bands of catgut
towards or from each other. It was beaten with two drumsticks
slightly bent. The Egyptians had also straight drumsticks with
a handle, and a knob at the end. The Berlin museum possesses
some of these. The third kind of drum was almost identical
with the <i>darabouka</i> (or <i>darabukkeh</i>) of the modern Egyptians.
The Tambourine was either round, like that which is at the
present time in use in Europe as well as in the east; or it was
of an oblong square shape, slightly incurved on the four sides.</p>

<p>The Sistrum consisted of a frame of bronze or brass into which
three or four metal bars were loosely inserted, so as to produce a
jingling noise when the instrument was shaken. The bars were
often made in the form of snakes, or they terminated in the head
of a goose. Not unfrequently a few metal rings were strung on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the bars, to increase the noise. The frame was sometimes ornamented
with the figure of a cat. The largest sistra which have
been found are about eighteen inches in length, and the smallest
about nine inches. The sistrum was principally used by females
in religious performances. Its Egyptian name was <i>seshesh</i>.</p>

<p>The Egyptian cymbals closely resembled our own in shape.
There are two pairs of them in the British museum. One pair
was found in a coffin enclosing the mummy of a sacred musician,
and is deposited in the same case with the mummy and coffin.
Among the Egyptian antiquities in the British museum are also
several small bells of bronze. The largest is 2&frac14; inches in height,
and the smallest three-quarters of an inch. Some of them have
a hole at the side near the top wherein the clapper was fastened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Assyrians.</span></h3>

<p>Our acquaintance with the Assyrian instruments has been
derived almost entirely from the famous bas-reliefs which have
been excavated from the mounds of Nimroud, Khorsabad, and
Kouyunjik, situated near the river Tigris in the vicinity of the
town of Mosul in Asiatic Turkey.</p>

<p>The Assyrian harp was about four feet high, and appears of
larger size than it actually was on account of the ornamental
appendages which were affixed to the lower part of its frame. It
must have been but light in weight, since we find it not unfrequently
represented in the hands of persons who are playing upon
it while they are dancing. Like all the Oriental harps, modern
as well as ancient, it was not provided with a front pillar. The
upper portion of the frame contained the sound-holes, somewhat
in the shape of an hour-glass. Below them were the screws, or
tuning-pegs, arranged in regular order. The strings were perhaps
made of silk, like those which the Burmese use at the present
time on their harps; or they may have been of catgut, which was
used by the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The largest assemblage of Assyrian musicians which has been
discovered on any monument consists of eleven performers upon
instruments, besides a chorus of singers. The first musician&mdash;probably
the leader of the band, as he marches alone at the head
of the procession&mdash;is playing upon a harp. Behind him are two
men; one with a dulcimer and the other with a double-pipe:
then follow two men with harps. Next come six female musicians,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
four of whom are playing upon harps, while one is blowing a
double-pipe and another is beating a small hand-drum covered
only at the top. Close behind the instrumental performers are
the singers, consisting of a chorus of females and children. They
are clapping their hands in time with the music, and some of the
musicians are dancing to the measure. One of the female singers
is holding her hand to her throat in the same manner as the
women in Syria, Arabia, and Persia are in the habit of doing at
the present day when producing, on festive occasions, those peculiarly
shrill sounds of rejoicing which have been repeatedly noticed
by travellers.</p>

<p>The dulcimer is in too imperfect a state on the bas-relief to
familiarize us with its construction. The slab representing the
procession in which it occurs has been injured; the defect which
extended over a portion of the dulcimer has been repaired, and
it cannot be said that in repairing it much musical knowledge has
been evinced.</p>

<p>The instrument of the Trigonon species was held horizontally,
and was twanged with a rather long plectrum slightly bent at the
end at which it was held by the performer. It is of frequent
occurrence on the bas-reliefs. A number of them appear to have
been generally played together. At any rate, we find almost
invariably on the monuments two together, evidently implying
“more than one,” “a number.” The left hand of the performer
seems to have been occupied in checking the vibration of the
strings when its discontinuance was required. From the position
of the strings the performer could not have struck them as those
of the dulcimer are struck. If he did not twang them, he may
have drawn the plectrum across them. Indeed, for twanging, a
short plectrum would have been more practical, considering that
the strings are placed horizontally one above the other at regular
distances. It is therefore by no means improbable that we have
here a rude prototype of the violin bow.</p>

<p>The Lyre occurs in three different forms, and is held horizontally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
in playing, or at least nearly so. Its front bar was generally
either oblique or slightly curved. The strings were tied round the
bar so as to allow of their being pushed upwards or downwards.
In the former case the tension of the strings increases, and the
notes become therefore higher; on the other hand, if the strings
are pushed lower down the pitch of the notes must become
deeper. The lyre was played with a small plectrum as well as
with the fingers.</p>

<p>The Assyrian trumpet was very similar to the Egyptian.
Furthermore, we meet with three kinds of drums, of which one is
especially noteworthy on account of its odd shape, somewhat
resembling a sugar-loaf; with the tambourine; with two kinds of
cymbals; and with bells, of which a considerable number have
been found in the mound of Nimroud. These bells, which have
greatly withstood the devastation of time, are but small in size,
the largest of them being only 3&frac14; inches in height and 2&frac12; inches
in diameter. Most of them have a hole at the top, in which
probably the clapper was fastened. They are made of copper
mixed with 14 per cent. of tin.</p>

<p>Instrumental music was used by the Assyrians and Babylonians
in their religious observances. This is obvious from the sculptures,
and is to some extent confirmed by the mode of worship
paid by command of king Nebuchadnezzar to the golden image:
“Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of
the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds
of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that
Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.” The kings appear to
have maintained at their courts musical bands, whose office it was
to perform secular music at certain times of the day or on fixed
occasions. Of king Darius we are told that, when he had cast
Daniel into the den of lions, he “went to his palace, and passed
the night fasting, neither were instruments of musick brought
before him;” from which we may conclude that his band was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the habit of playing before him in the evening. A similar custom
prevailed also at the court of Jerusalem, at least in the time of
David and Solomon; both of whom appear to have had their
royal private bands, besides a large number of singers and instrumental
performers of sacred music who were engaged in the
Temple.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Hebrews.</span></h3>

<p>As regards the musical instruments of the Hebrews, we are from
biblical records acquainted with the names of many of them; but
representations to be trusted are still wanting, and it is chiefly from
an examination of the ancient Egyptian and Assyrian instruments
that we can conjecture almost to a certainty their construction
and capabilities. From various indications, which it would be
too circumstantial here to point out, we believe the Hebrews to
have possessed the following instruments:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Harp.</span> There cannot be a doubt that the Hebrews possessed
the harp, seeing that it was a common instrument among
the Egyptians and Assyrians. But it is uncertain which of the
Hebrew names of the stringed instruments occurring in the Bible
really designates the harp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dulcimer.</span> Some writers on Hebrew music consider the
<i>nebel</i> to have been a kind of dulcimer; others conjecture the same
of the <i>psanterin</i> mentioned in the book of Daniel,&mdash;a name which
appears to be synonymous with the <i>psalterion</i> of the Greeks, and
from which also the present oriental dulcimer, <i>santir</i>, may have
been derived. Some of the instruments mentioned in the book of
Daniel may have been synonymous with some which occur in
other parts of the Bible under Hebrew names; the names given
in Daniel being Chald&aelig;an. The <i>asor</i> was a ten-stringed instrument
played with a plectrum, and is supposed to have borne some
resemblance to the <i>nebel</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lyre.</span> This instrument is represented on some Hebrew
coins generally ascribed to Judas Maccab&aelig;us, who lived in the
second century before the Christian era. There are several of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
in the British museum; some are of silver, and the others of
copper. On three of them are lyres with three strings, another
has one with five, and another one with six strings. The two
sides of the frame appear to have been made of the horns of
animals, or they may have been of wood formed in imitation of
two horns which originally were used. Lyres thus constructed
are still found in Abyssinia. The Hebrew square-shaped lyre of
the time of Simon Maccab&aelig;us is probably identical with the
<i>psalterion</i>. The <i>kinnor</i>, the favourite instrument of king David,
was most likely a lyre if not a small triangular harp. The lyre
was evidently an universally known and favoured instrument
among ancient eastern nations. Being more simple in construction
than most other stringed instruments it undoubtedly preceded
them in antiquity. The <i>kinnor</i> is mentioned in the Bible
as the oldest stringed instrument, and as the invention of Jubal.
Even if the name of one particular stringed instrument is here
used for stringed instruments in general, which may possibly be
the case, it is only reasonable to suppose that the oldest and most
universally known stringed instrument would be mentioned as a
representative of the whole class rather than any other. Besides,
the <i>kinnor</i> was a light and easily portable instrument; king David,
according to the Rabbinic records, used to suspend it during the
night over his pillow. All its uses mentioned in the Bible are
especially applicable to the lyre. And the resemblance of the
word <i>kinnor</i> to <i>kithara</i>, <i>kissar</i>, and similar names known to denote
the lyre, also tends to confirm the supposition that it refers to
this instrument. It is, however, not likely that the instruments
of the Hebrews&mdash;indeed their music altogether&mdash;should have
remained entirely unchanged during a period of many centuries.
Some modifications were likely to occur even from accidental
causes; such, for instance, as the influence of neighbouring
nations when the Hebrews came into closer contact with them.
Thus may be explained why the accounts of the Hebrew instruments
given by Josephus, who lived in the first century of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Christian era, are not in exact accordance with those in the Bible.
The lyres at the time of Simon Maccab&aelig;us may probably be
different from those which were in use about a thousand years
earlier, or at the time of David and Solomon when the art of
music with the Hebrews was at its zenith.</p>

<p>There appears to be a probability that a Hebrew lyre of the
time of Joseph (about 1700 <small>B.C.</small>) is represented on an ancient
Egyptian painting discovered in a tomb at Beni Hassan,&mdash;which
is the name of certain grottoes on the eastern bank of the Nile.
Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his “Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Egyptians,” observes: “If, when we become better
acquainted with the interpretation of hieroglyphics, the ‘Strangers’
at Beni Hassan should prove to be the arrival of Jacob’s family in
Egypt, we may examine the Jewish lyre drawn by an Egyptian
artist. That this event took place about the period when the
inmate of the tomb lived is highly probable&mdash;at least, if I am
correct in considering Osirtasen I. to be the Pharaoh the patron
of Joseph; and it remains for us to decide whether the disagreement
in the number of persons here introduced&mdash;thirty-seven
being written over them in hieroglyphics&mdash;is a sufficient objection
to their identity. It will not be foreign to the present subject
to introduce those figures which are curious, if only considered as
illustrative of ancient customs at that early period, and which will
be looked upon with unbounded interest should they ever be
found to refer to the Jews. The first figure is an Egyptian scribe,
who presents an account of their arrival to a person seated, the
owner of the tomb, and one of the principal officers of the
reigning Pharaoh. The next, also an Egyptian, ushers them into
his presence; and two advance bringing presents, the wild goat
or ibex and the gazelle, the productions of their country. Four
men, carrying bows and clubs, follow, leading an ass on which
two children are placed in panniers, accompanied by a boy and
four women; and, last of all, another ass laden, and two men&mdash;one
holding a bow and club, the other a lyre, which he plays with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
a plectrum. All the men have beards, contrary to the custom of
the Egyptians, but very general in the East at that period, and
noticed as a peculiarity of foreign uncivilized nations throughout
their sculptures. The men have sandals, the women a sort of
boot reaching to the ankle&mdash;both which were worn by many
Asiatic people. The lyre is rude, and differs in form from those
generally used in Egypt.” In the engraving the lyre-player,
another man, and some strange animals from this group, are
represented.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tamboura.</span> <i>Minnim</i>, <i>machalath</i>, and <i>nebel</i> are usually
supposed to be the names of instruments of the lute or guitar
kind. <i>Minnim</i>, however, appears more likely to imply stringed
instruments in general than any particular instrument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Single Pipe.</span> <i>Chalil</i> and <i>nekeb</i> were the names of the
Hebrew pipes or flutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Double Pipe.</span> Probably the <i>mishrokitha</i> mentioned in
Daniel. The <i>mishrokitha</i> is represented in the drawings of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
histories of music as a small organ, consisting of seven pipes
placed in a box with a mouthpiece for blowing. But the shape
of the pipes and of the box as well as the row of keys for the
fingers exhibited in the representation of the <i>mishrokitha</i> have too
much of the European type not to suggest that they are probably
a product of the imagination. Respecting the illustrations of
Hebrew instruments which usually accompany historical treatises
on music and commentaries on the Bible, it ought to be borne in
mind that most of them are merely the offspring of conjectures
founded on some obscure hints in the Bible, or vague accounts by
the Rabbins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Syrinx or Pandean Pipe.</span> Probably the <i>ugab</i>, which in
the English authorized version of the Bible is rendered “organ.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bagpipe.</span> The word <i>sumphonia</i>, which occurs in the book
of Daniel, is, by Forkel and others, supposed to denote a bagpipe.
It is remarkable that at the present day the bagpipe is called by
the Italian peasantry Zampogna. Another Hebrew instrument,
the <i>magrepha</i>, generally described as an organ, was more likely
only a kind of bagpipe. The <i>magrepha</i> is not mentioned in the
Bible but is described in the Talmud. In tract Erachin it is
recorded to have been a powerful organ which stood in the temple
at Jerusalem, and consisted of a case or wind-chest, with ten
holes, containing ten pipes. Each pipe was capable of emitting
ten different sounds, by means of finger-holes or some similar
contrivance: thus one hundred different sounds could be produced
on this instrument. Further, the <i>magrepha</i> is said to have
been provided with two pairs of bellows and with ten keys, by
means of which it was played with the fingers. Its tone was,
according to the Rabbinic accounts, so loud that it could be
heard at an incredibly long distance from the temple. Authorities
so widely differ that we must leave it uncertain whether the much-lauded
<i>magrepha</i> was a bagpipe, an organ, or a kettle-drum. Of
the real nature of the Hebrew bagpipe perhaps some idea may be
formed from a syrinx with bellows, which has been found represented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
on one of the ancient terra-cottas excavated in Tarsus,
Asia-minor, some years since, and here engraved. These
remains are believed to be
about 2000 years old, judging
from the figures upon
them, and from some coins
struck about 200 years <small>B.C.</small>
having been found embedded
with them. We have
therefore before us, probably,
the oldest representation
of a bagpipe
hitherto discovered.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i024" src="images/i024.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Trumpet.</span> Three kinds are mentioned in the Bible, viz.
the <i>keren</i>, the <i>shophar</i>, and the <i>chatzozerah</i>. The first two were
more or less curved and might properly be considered as horns.
Most commentators are of opinion that the <i>keren</i>&mdash;made of ram’s
horn&mdash;was almost identical with the <i>shophar</i>, the only difference
being that the latter was more curved than the former. The
<i>shophar</i> is especially remarkable as being the only Hebrew
musical instrument which has been preserved to the present day
in the religious services of the Jews. It is still blown in the
synagogue, as in time of old, at the Jewish new-year’s festival,
according to the command of Moses (Numb. <span class="smcap">xxix. I</span>). The
<i>chatzozerah</i> was a straight trumpet, about two feet in length, and
was sometimes made of silver. Two of these straight trumpets are
shown in the famous triumphal procession after the fall of
Jerusalem on the arch of Titus, engraved on the next page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Drum.</span> There can be no doubt that the Hebrews had
several kinds of drums. We know, however, only of the <i>toph</i>,
which appears to have been a tambourine or a small hand-drum
like the Egyptian darabouka. In the English version of the
Bible the word is rendered <i>timbrel</i> or <i>tabret</i>. This instrument was
especially used in processions on occasions of rejoicing, and also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
frequently by females. We find it in the hands of Miriam, when
she was celebrating with the Israelitish women in songs of joy the
destruction of Pharaoh’s host; and in the hands of Jephtha’s
daughter, when she went out to welcome her father. There
exists at the present day in the East a small hand-drum called
<i>doff</i>, <i>diff</i>, or <i>adufe</i>&mdash;a name which appears to be synonymous with
the Hebrew <i>toph</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i025" src="images/i025.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sistrum.</span> Winer, Saalfch&uuml;tz, and several other commentators
are of opinion that the <i>menaaneim</i>, mentioned in 2 Sam. vi.
5, denotes the sistrum. In the English Bible the original is translated
<i>cymbals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cymbals.</span> The <i>tzeltzclim</i>, <i>metzilloth</i>, and <i>metzilthaim</i>, appear
to have been cymbals or similar metallic instruments of percussion,
differing in shape and sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bells.</span> The little bells on the vestments of the high-priest were
called <i>phaamon</i>. Small golden bells were attached to the lower
part of the robes of the high-priest in his sacred ministrations.
The Jews have, at the present day, in their synagogues small bells
fastened to the rolls of the Law containing the Pentateuch: a
kind of ornamentation which is supposed to have been in use
from time immemorial.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Besides the names of Hebrew instruments already given there
occur several others in the Old Testament, upon the real meaning
of which much diversity of opinion prevails. <i>Jobel</i> is by some
commentators classed with the trumpets, but it is by others
believed to designate a loud and cheerful blast of the trumpet,
used on particular occasions. If <i>Jobel</i> (from which <i>jubilare</i> is
supposed to be derived) is identical with the name <i>Jubal</i>, the
inventor of musical instruments, it would appear that the Hebrews
appreciated pre-eminently the exhilarating power of music. <i>Shalisbim</i>
is supposed to denote a triangle. <i>Nechiloth</i>, <i>gittith</i>, and
<i>machalath</i>, which occur in the headings of some psalms, are also
by commentators supposed to be musical instruments. <i>Nechiloth</i>
is said to have been a flute, and <i>gittith</i> and <i>machalath</i> to have
been stringed instruments, and <i>machol</i> a kind of flute. Again,
others maintain that the words denote peculiar modes of performance
or certain favourite melodies to which the psalms were
directed to be sung, or chanted. According to the records of the
Rabbins, the Hebrews in the time of David and Solomon possessed
thirty-six different musical instruments. In the Bible only
about half that number are mentioned.</p>

<p>Most nations of antiquity ascribed the invention of their musical
instruments to their gods, or to certain superhuman beings. The
Hebrews attributed it to man; Jubal is mentioned in Genesis as
“the father of all such as handle the harp and organ” (<i>i.e.</i>, performers
on stringed instruments and wind instruments). As instruments
of percussion are almost invariably in use long before people
are led to construct stringed and wind instruments it might perhaps
be surmised that Jubal was not regarded as the inventor of
all the Hebrew instruments, but rather as the first professional
cultivator of instrumental music.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Greeks.</span></h3>

<p>Many musical instruments of the ancient Greeks are known to us
by name; but respecting their exact construction and capabilities
there still prevails almost as much diversity of opinion as is the
case with those of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the Greeks derived their musical
system from the Egyptians. Pythagoras and other philosophers
are said to have studied music in Egypt. It would, however,
appear that the Egyptian influence upon Greece, as far as regards
this art, has been overrated. Not only have the more perfect
Egyptian instruments&mdash;such as the larger harps, the tamboura&mdash;never
been much in favour with the Greeks, but almost all the
stringed instruments which the Greeks possessed are stated to
have been originally derived from Asia. Strabo says: “Those
who regard the whole of Asia, as far as India, as consecrated to
Bacchus, point to that country as the origin of a great portion of
the present music. One author speaks of ‘striking forcibly the
Asiatic kithara,’ another calls the pipes Berecynthian and Phrygian.
Some of the instruments also have foreign names, as Nabla, Sambuka,
Barbiton, Magadis, and many others.”</p>

<p>We know at present little more of these instruments than that
they were in use in Greece. Of the Magadis it is even not satisfactorily
ascertained whether it was a stringed or a wind instrument.
The other three are known to have been stringed instruments.
But they cannot have been anything like such universal favourites
as the lyre, because this instrument and perhaps the <i>trigonon</i> are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
almost the only stringed instruments represented in the Greek
paintings on pottery and other monumental records. If, as might
perhaps be suggested, their taste for beauty of form induced the
Greeks to represent the elegant lyre in preference to other stringed
instruments, we might at least expect to meet with the harp; an
instrument which equals if it does not surpass the lyre in elegance
of form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i028" src="images/i028.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The representation of Polyhymnia with a harp, depicted on a
splendid Greek vase now in the Munich museum, may be noted
as an exceptional instance. This valuable relic dates from the
time of Alexander the great. The instrument resembles in construction
as well as in shape the Assyrian harp, and has thirteen
strings. Polyhymnia is touching them with both hands, using the
right hand for the treble and the left for the bass. She is seated,
holding the instrument in her lap. Even the little tuning-pegs,
which in number are not in accordance with the strings, are placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
on the sound-board at the upper part of the frame, exactly as on
the Assyrian harp. If then we have here the Greek harp, it was
more likely an importation from Asia than from Egypt. In short,
as far as can be ascertained, the most complete of the Greek
instruments appear to be of Asiatic origin. Especially from the
nations who inhabited Asia-minor the Greeks are stated to have
adopted several of the most popular. Thus we may read of the
short and shrill-sounding pipes of the Carians; of the Phrygian
pastoral flute, consisting of several tubes united; of the three-stringed
<i>kithara</i> of the Lydians; and so on.</p>

<p>The Greeks called the harp <i>kinyra</i>, and this may be the reason
why in the English translation of the Bible the <i>kinnor</i> of the
Hebrews, the favourite instrument of king David, is rendered <i>harp</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i029" src="images/i029.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Greeks had lyres of various kinds, shown in the accompanying
woodcuts, more or less differing in construction, form,
and size, and distinguished by different names; such as <i>lyra</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
<i>kithara</i>, <i>chelys</i>, <i>phorminx</i>, etc. <i>Lyra</i> appears to have implied
instruments of this class in general, and also the lyre with a body
oval at the base and held upon the lap or in the arms of the
performer; while the <i>kithara</i> had a square base and was held
against the breast. These distinctions have, however, not been
satisfactorily ascertained. The <i>chelys</i> was a small lyre with the
body made of the shell of a tortoise, or of wood in imitation
of the tortoise. The <i>phorminx</i> was a large lyre; and, like the
<i>kithara</i>, was used at an early period singly, for accompanying
recitations. It is recorded that the <i>kithara</i> was employed for solo
performances as early as <small>B.C.</small> 700.</p>

<p>The design on the Grecian vase at Munich (already alluded
to) represents the nine muses, of whom three are given in the
engraving, viz., Polyhymnia with the harp, and Kalliope and
Erato with lyres. It will be observed that some of the lyres
engraved in the woodcuts on page 29 are provided with a bridge,
while others are without it. The largest were held probably on
or between the knees, or were attached to the left arm by means
of a band, to enable the performer to use his hands without
impediment. The strings, made of catgut or sinew, were more
usually twanged with a <i>plektron</i> than merely with the fingers.
The <i>plektron</i> was a short stem of ivory or metal pointed at both
ends.</p>

<p>A fragment of a Greek lyre which was found in a tomb near
Athens is deposited in the British museum. The two pieces constituting
its frame are of wood. Their length is about eighteen
inches, and the length of the cross-bar at the top is about nine
inches. The instrument is unhappily in a condition too dilapidated
and imperfect to be of any essential use to the musical inquirer.</p>

<p>The <i>trigonon</i> consisted originally of an angular frame, to which
the strings were affixed. In the course of time a third bar was
added to resist the tension of the strings, and its triangular frame
resembled in shape the Greek delta. Subsequently it was still
further improved, the upper bar of the frame being made slightly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
curved, whereby the instrument obtained greater strength and
more elegance of form.</p>

<p>The <i>magadis</i>, also called <i>pektis</i>, had twenty strings which were
tuned in octaves, and therefore produced only ten tones. It
appears to have been some sort of dulcimer, but information
respecting its construction is still wanting. There appears to
have been also a kind of bagpipe in use called <i>magadis</i>, of which
nothing certain is known. Possibly, the same name may have
been applied to two different instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i031" src="images/i031.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>barbiton</i> was likewise a stringed instrument of this kind.
The <i>sambyke</i> is traditionally said to have been invented by
Ibykos, <small>B.C.</small> 540. The <i>simmikon</i> had thirty-five strings, and
derived its name from its inventor, Simos, who lived about <small>B.C.</small>
600. It was perhaps a kind of dulcimer. The <i>nabla</i> had only
two strings, and probably resembled the <i>nebel</i> of the Hebrews, of
which but little is known with certainty. The <i>pandoura</i> is supposed
to have been a kind of lute with three strings. Several of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the instruments just noticed were used in Greece, chiefly by
musicians who had immigrated from Asia; they can therefore
hardly be considered as national musical instruments of the
Greeks. The <i>monochord</i> had (as its name implies) only a single
string, and was used in teaching singing and the laws of acoustics.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i032" src="images/i032.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The flute, <i>aulos</i>, of which there were many varieties, as shown
in the woodcut p. 31, was a highly popular instrument, and differed
in construction from the flutes and pipes of the ancient Egyptians.
Instead of being blown through a hole at the side near the top it
was held like a flageolet, and a
vibrating reed was inserted into
the mouth-piece, so that it might
be more properly described as a
kind of oboe or clarionet. The
Greeks were accustomed to designate
by the name of <i>aulos</i> all wind
instruments of the flute and oboe
kind, some of which were constructed
like the flageolet or like
our antiquated <i>fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec</i>. The
single flute was called <i>monaulos</i>,
and the double one <i>diaulos</i>. A
<i>diaulos</i>, which was found in a
tomb at Athens, is in the British
museum. The wood of which it
is made seems to be cedar, and
the tubes are fifteen inches in
length. Each tube has a separate mouth-piece and six finger-holes,
five of which are at the upper side and one is underneath.</p>

<p>The <i>syrinx</i>, or Pandean pipe, had from three to nine tubes, but
seven was the usual number. The straight trumpet, <i>salpinx</i>, and
the curved horn, <i>keras</i>, made of brass, were used exclusively in
war. The small hand-drum, called <i>tympanon</i>, resembled in shape
our tambourine, but was covered with parchment at the back as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
well as at the front. The <i>kymbala</i> were made of metal, and
resembled our small cymbals. The <i>krotala</i> were almost identical
with our castanets, and were made of wood or metal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Etruscans and Romans.</span></h3>

<p>The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most
popular instruments originally from the Etruscans; a people
which at an early period excelled all other Italian nations in the
cultivation of the arts as well as in social refinement, and which
possessed musical instruments similar to those of the Greeks.
It must, however, be remembered that many of the vases and
other specimens of art which have been found in Etruscan tombs,
and on which delineations of lyres and other instruments occur,
are supposed to be productions of Greek artists whose works
were obtained from Greece by the Etruscans, or who were
induced to settle in Etruria.</p>

<p>The flutes of the Etruscans were not unfrequently made of
ivory; those used in religious sacrifices were of box-wood, of a
species of the lotus, of ass’ bone, bronze and silver. A bronze
flute, somewhat resembling our flageolet, has been found in a
tomb; likewise a huge trumpet of bronze. An Etruscan <i>cornu</i>
(engraved) is deposited in the British museum, and measures
about four feet in length.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i033" src="images/i033.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To the Etruscans is also attributed by some the invention of the
hydraulic organ.
The Greeks possessed
a somewhat
similar contrivance
which they called <i>hydraulos</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> water-flute,
and which
probably was
identical with the
<i>organum hydraulicum</i> of the Romans. The instrument ought more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
properly to be regarded as a pneumatic organ, for the sound was
produced by the current of air through the pipes; the water
applied serving merely to give the necessary pressure to the
bellows and to regulate their action. The pipes were probably
caused to sound by means of stops, perhaps resembling those
on our organ, which were drawn out or pushed in. The construction
was evidently but a primitive contrivance, contained
in a case which could be carried by one or two persons and
which was placed on a table. The highest degree of perfection
which the hydraulic organ obtained with the ancients is perhaps
shown in a representation on a coin
of the emperor Nero, in the British
museum. Only ten pipes are given
to it and there is no indication of
any key board, which would probably
have been shown had it existed. The
man standing at the side and holding
a laurel leaf in his hand is
surmised to represent a victor in the
exhibitions of the circus or the amphitheatre.
The hydraulic organ probably
was played on such occasions; and the medal containing
an impression of it may have been bestowed upon the victor.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i034" src="images/i034.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>During the time of the republic, and especially subsequently
under the reign of the emperors, the Romans adopted many new
instruments from Greece, Egypt, and even from western Asia;
without essentially improving any of their importations.</p>

<p>Their most favourite stringed instrument was the lyre, of which
they had various kinds, called, according to their form and
arrangement of strings, <i>lyra</i>, <i>cithara</i>, <i>chelys</i>, <i>testudo</i>, <i>fidis</i> (or <i>fides</i>),
and <i>cornu</i>. The name <i>cornu</i> was given to the lyre when the
sides of the frame terminated at the top in the shape of two horns.
The <i>barbitos</i> was a kind of lyre with a large body, which gave
the instrument somewhat the shape of the Welsh <i>crwth</i>. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
<i>psalterium</i> was a kind of lyre of an oblong square shape. Like
most of the Roman lyres, it was played with a rather large
plectrum. The <i>trigonum</i> was the same as the Greek <i>trigonon</i>,
and was probably originally derived from Egypt. It is recorded
that a certain musician of the name of Alexander Alexandrinus
was so admirable a performer upon it that when exhibiting his
skill in Rome he created the greatest <i>furore</i>. Less common, and
derived from Asia, were the <i>sambuca</i> and <i>nablia</i>, the exact construction
of which is unknown.</p>

<p>The flute, <i>tibia</i>, was originally made of the shin bone, and had
a mouth-hole and four finger-holes. Its shape was retained
even when, at a later period, it was constructed of other substances
than bone. The <i>tibia gingrina</i> consisted of a long and
thin tube of reed with a mouth-hole at the side of one end. The
<i>tibia obliqua</i> and <i>tibia vasca</i> were provided with mouth-pieces
affixed at a right angle to the tube; a contrivance somewhat
similar to that on our bassoon. The <i>tibia longa</i> was especially
used in religious worship. The <i>tibia curva</i> was curved at its
broadest end. The <i>tibia ligula</i> appears to have resembled our
flageolet. The <i>calamus</i> was nothing more than a simple pipe cut
off the kind of reed which the ancients used as a pen for writing.</p>

<p>The Romans had double flutes as well as single flutes. The
double flute consisted of two tubes united, either so as to have a
mouth-piece in common or to have each a separate mouth-piece.
If the tubes were exactly alike the double flute was called <i>Tibi&aelig;
pares</i>; if they were different from each other, <i>Tibi&aelig; impares</i>.
Little plugs, or stoppers, were inserted into the finger-holes to
regulate the order of intervals. The <i>tibia</i> was made in various
shapes. The <i>tibia dextra</i> was usually constructed of the upper
and thinner part of a reed; and the <i>tibia sinistra</i>, of the lower
and broader part. The performers used also the <i>capistrum</i>,&mdash;a
bandage round the cheeks identical with the <i>phorbeia</i> of the
Greeks.</p>

<p>The British museum contains a mosaic figure of a Roman girl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
playing the <i>tibia</i>, which is stated to have been disinterred in the
year 1823 on the Via Appia. Here the <i>holmos</i> or mouth-piece,
somewhat resembling the reed of
our oboe, is distinctly shown.
The finger-holes, probably four,
are not indicated, although they
undoubtedly existed on the instrument.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i036a" src="images/i036a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Furthermore, the Romans had
two kinds of Pandean pipes, viz.
the <i>syrinx</i> and the <i>fistula</i>. The
bagpipe, <i>tibia utricularis</i>, is said to
have been a favourite instrument
of the emperor Nero.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i036b" src="images/i036b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>cornu</i> was a large horn of
bronze, curved. The performer
held it under his arm with the broad end upwards over his
shoulder. It is represented
in the engraving,
with the <i>tuba</i> and
the <i>lituus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>tuba</i> was a
straight trumpet. Both
the <i>cornu</i> and the <i>tuba</i>
were employed in war
to convey signals. The
same was the case with
the <i>buccina</i>,&mdash;originally
perhaps a conch
shell, and afterwards a
simple horn of an animal,&mdash;and
the <i>lituus</i>, which was bent at the broad end but
otherwise straight. The <i>tympanum</i> resembled the tambourine
and was beaten like the latter with the hands. Among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Roman instruments of percussion the <i>scabillum</i>, which consisted
of two plates combined by means of a sort of hinge, deserves
to be noticed; it was fastened under the foot and trodden in
time, to produce certain rhythmical effects in musical performances.
The <i>cymbalum</i> consisted of two metal plates similar
to our cymbals. The <i>crotala</i> and the <i>crusmata</i> were kinds of
castanets, the former being oblong and of a larger size than the
latter. The Romans had also a <i>triangulum</i>, which resembled
the triangle occasionally used in our orchestra. The <i>sistrum</i>
they derived from Egypt with the introduction of the worship of
Isis. Metal bells, arranged according to a regular order of intervals
and placed in a frame, were called <i>tintinnabula</i>. The
<i>crepitaculum</i> appears to have been a somewhat similar contrivance
on a hoop with a handle.</p>

<p>Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated
proof of musical instruments having been introduced into
Europe from Asia. The Romans in their conquests undoubtedly
made their musical instruments known, to some extent, also in
western Europe. But the Greeks and Romans are not the only
nations which introduced eastern instruments into Europe. The
Phœnicians at an early period colonized Sardinia, and traces of
them are still to be found on that island. Among these is a
peculiarly constructed double-pipe, called <i>lionedda</i> or <i>launedda</i>.
Again, at a much later period the Arabs introduced several of
their instruments into Spain, from which country they became
known in France, Germany, and England. Also the crusaders,
during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, may have helped to
familiarize the western European nations with instruments of
the east.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Chinese.</span></h3>

<p>Allowing for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural to the
lively imagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to doubt that
the Chinese possessed long before our Christian era musical
instruments to which they attribute a fabulously high antiquity.
There is an ancient tradition, according to which they obtained
their musical scale from a miraculous bird, called foung-hoang,
which appears to have been a sort of phœnix. When Confucius,
who lived about <small>B.C.</small> 500, happened to hear on a certain occasion
some Chinese music, he became so greatly enraptured that he
could not take any food for three months afterwards. The
sounds which produced this effect were those of Kouei, the
Orpheus of the Chinese, whose performance on the <i>king</i>&mdash;a kind
of harmonicon constructed of slabs of sonorous stone&mdash;would
draw wild animals around him and make them subservient to
his will. As regards the invention of musical instruments the
Chinese have other traditions. In one of these we are told that
the origin of some of their most popular instruments dates from
the period when China was under the dominion of heavenly
spirits, called Ki. Another assigns the invention of several
stringed instruments to the great Fohi who was the founder of
the empire and who lived about <small>B.C.</small> 3000, which was long after
the dominion of the Ki, or spirits. Again, another tradition holds
that the most important instruments and systematic arrangements
of sounds are an invention of Niuva, a supernatural female,
who lived at the time of Fohi.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i039" src="images/i039.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>According to their records, the Chinese possessed their much-esteemed
<i>king</i> 2200 years before our Christian era, and employed
it for accompanying songs of praise. It was regarded as a sacred
instrument. During religious observances at the solemn moment
when the <i>king</i> was sounded sticks of incense were burnt. It
was likewise played before the emperor early in the morning
when he awoke. The Chinese have long since constructed
various kinds of the <i>king</i>, one of which is here engraved, by
using different species of stones. Their most famous stone
selected for this purpose is called <i>yu</i>. It is not only very
sonorous but also beautiful in appearance. The <i>yu</i> is found
in mountain streams and crevices of rocks. The largest specimens
found measure from two to three feet in diameter, but of
this size examples rarely occur. The <i>yu</i> is very hard and heavy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Some European mineralogists, to whom the missionaries transmitted
specimens for examination, pronounce it to be a species
of agate. It is found of different colours, and the Chinese
appear to have preferred in different centuries particular colours
for the <i>king</i>.</p>

<p>The Chinese consider the <i>yu</i> especially valuable for musical
purposes, because it always retains exactly the same pitch. All
other musical instruments, they say, are in this respect doubtful;
but the tone of the <i>yu</i> is neither influenced by cold nor heat, nor
by humidity, nor dryness.</p>

<p>The stones used for the <i>king</i> have been cut from time to time
in various grotesque shapes. Some represent animals: as, for
instance, a bat with outstretched wings; or two fishes placed
side by side: others are in the shape of an ancient Chinese bell.
The angular shape shown in the engraving appears to be the
oldest and is still retained in the ornamented stones of the <i>pien-king</i>,
which is a more modern instrument than the <i>king</i>. The
tones of the <i>pien-king</i> are attuned according to the Chinese
intervals called <i>lu</i>, of which there are twelve in the compass
of an octave. The same is the case with the other Chinese
instruments of this class. They vary, however, in pitch. The
pitch of the <i>soung-king</i>, for instance, is four intervals lower than
that of the <i>pien-king</i>.</p>

<p>Sonorous stones have always been used by the Chinese also
singly, as rhythmical instruments. Such a single stone is called
<i>tse-king</i>. Probably certain curious relics belonging to a temple in
Peking, erected for the worship of Confucius, serve a similar purpose.
In one of the outbuildings or the temple are ten sonorous
stones, shaped like drums, which are asserted to have been cut
about three thousand years ago. The primitive Chinese characters
engraven upon them are nearly obliterated.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese had several kinds of bells, frequently
arranged in sets so as to constitute a musical scale. The Chinese
name for the bell is <i>tchung</i>. At an early period they had a somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
square-shaped bell called <i>t&eacute;-tchung</i>. Like other ancient
Chinese bells it was made of copper alloyed with tin, the
proportion being one pound of tin to six of copper. The <i>t&eacute;-tchung</i>,
which is also known by the name of <i>piao</i>, was principally
used to indicate the time and divisions in musical performances.
It had a fixed pitch of sound, and several of these bells
attuned to a certain order of intervals were not unfrequently
ranged in a regular succession, thus forming a musical instrument
which was called <i>pien-tchung</i>. The musical scale of the sixteen
bells which the <i>pien-tchung</i> contained was the same as that of the
<i>king</i> before mentioned.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i041" src="images/i041.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>hiuen-tchung</i> was, according to popular tradition, included
with the antique instruments at the time of Confucius, and came
into popular use during the Han dynasty (from <small>B.C.</small> 200 until
<small>A.D.</small> 200). It was of a peculiar oval shape and had nearly the
same quaint ornamentation as the <i>t&eacute;-tchung</i>; this consisted of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
symbolical figures, in four divisions, each containing nine mammals.
The mouth was crescent-shaped. Every figure had a deep
meaning referring to the seasons and
to the mysteries of the Buddhist
religion. The largest <i>hiuen-tchung</i>
was about twenty inches in length;
and, like the <i>t&eacute;-tchung</i>, was sounded
by means of a small wooden mallet
with an oval knob. None of the bells
of this description had a clapper. It
would, however, appear that the
Chinese had at an early period some
kind of bell provided with a wooden
tongue: this was used for military
purposes as well as for calling the
people together when an imperial
messenger promulgated his sovereign’s commands. An expression
of Confucius is recorded to the effect that he wished to be “A
wooden-tongued bell of Heaven,” <i>i.e.</i> a herald of heaven to proclaim
the divine purposes to the multitude.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i042" src="images/i042.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>fang-hiang</i> was a kind of wood-harmonicon. It contained
sixteen wooden slabs of an oblong square shape, suspended in a
wooden frame elegantly decorated. The slabs were arranged in
two tiers, one above the other, and were all of equal length and
breadth but differed in thickness. The <i>tchoung-tou</i> consisted of
twelve slips of bamboo, and was used for beating time and for
rhythmical purposes. The slips being banded together at one
end could be expanded somewhat like a fan. The Chinese state
that they used the <i>tchoung-tou</i> for writing upon before they
invented paper.</p>

<p>The <i>ou</i>, of which we give a woodcut, likewise an ancient Chinese
instrument of percussion and still in use, is made of wood in
the shape of a crouching tiger. It is hollow, and along its back
are about twenty small pieces of metal, pointed, and in appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
not unlike the teeth of a saw. The performer strikes them
with a sort of plectrum resembling a brush, or with a small stick
called <i>tchen</i>.
Occasionally
the <i>ou</i> is made
with pieces of
metal shaped
like reeds.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i043a" src="images/i043a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The ancient
<i>ou</i> was constructed
with
only six tones
which were attuned
thus&mdash;<i>f</i>,
<i>g</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>. The instrument appears to have become deteriorated
in the course of time; for, although it has gradually
acquired as many as twenty-seven pieces of metal, it evidently
serves at the present day more for the production of rhythmical
noise than for the execution of any melody. The modern <i>ou</i>
is made of a species of wood called <i>kieou</i> or <i>tsieou</i>: and the
tiger rests generally on a hollow wooden pedestal about three
feet six inches long, which serves as a sound-board.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i043b" src="images/i043b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>tchou</i>, likewise an instrument of percussion, was made of
the wood of a tree called <i>kieou-mou</i>, the stem of which resembles
that of the pine and whose foliage is
much like that of the cypress. It was
constructed of boards about three-quarters
of an inch in thickness. In the
middle of one of the sides was an aperture
into which the hand was passed for
the purpose of holding the handle of a
wooden hammer, the end of which
entered into a hole situated in the bottom of the <i>tchou</i>. The
handle was kept in its place by means of a wooden pin, on which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
it moved right and left when the instrument was struck with a
hammer. The Chinese ascribe to the <i>tchou</i> a very high antiquity,
as they almost invariably do with any of their inventions when
the date of its origin is unknown to them.</p>

<p>The <i>po-fou</i> was a drum, about one foot four inches in length,
and seven inches in diameter. It had a parchment at each end,
which was prepared in a peculiar way by being boiled in water.
The <i>po-fou</i> used to be partly filled with a preparation made from
the husk of rice, in order to mellow the sound. The Chinese
name for the drum is <i>kou</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i044" src="images/i044.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>kin-kou</i> (engraved), a large drum fixed on a pedestal which
raises it above six feet from the ground, is embellished with symbolical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
designs. A similar drum on which natural phenomena
are depicted is called <i>lei-kou</i>; and another of the kind, with
figures of certain birds and beasts which are regarded as symbols
of long life, is called <i>ling-kou</i>, and also <i>lou-kou</i>.</p>

<p>The flutes, <i>ty</i>, <i>yo</i>, and <i>tch&eacute;</i> were generally made of bamboo.
The <i>koan-tsee</i> was a Pandean pipe containing twelve tubes of
bamboo. The <i>siao</i>, likewise a Pandean pipe, contained sixteen
tubes. The <i>pai-siao</i> differed from the <i>siao</i> inasmuch as the tubes
were inserted into an oddly-shaped case highly ornamented with
grotesque designs and silken appendages.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i045" src="images/i045.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Chinese are known to have constructed at an early period
a curious wind-instrument, called <i>hiuen</i>. It was made of baked
clay and had five finger-holes, three of which were placed on one
side and two on the opposite side, as in the cut. Its tones were
in conformity with the pentatonic scale. The reader unacquainted
with the pentatonic scale
may ascertain its character
by playing on the pianoforte
the scale of C major
with the omission of <i>f</i> and
<i>b</i> (the <i>fourth</i> and <i>seventh</i>);
or by striking the black
keys in regular succession
from <i>f</i>-sharp to the next
<i>f</i>-sharp above or below.</p>

<p>Another curious wind-instrument of high antiquity, the <i>cheng</i>,
(engraved, p. 46) is still in use. Formerly it had either 13, 19, or
24 tubes, placed in a calabash; and a long curved tube served as
a mouth-piece. In olden time it was called <i>yu</i>.</p>

<p>The ancient stringed instruments, the <i>kin</i> and <i>ch&ecirc;</i>, were of the
dulcimer kind: they are still in use, and specimens of them are in
the South Kensington museum.</p>

<p>The Buddhists introduced from Thibet into China their god
of music, who is represented as a rather jovial-looking man with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
a moustache and an imperial, playing the <i>pepa</i>, a kind of lute
with four silken strings. Perhaps some interesting information
respecting the ancient Chinese musical
instruments may be gathered from the
famous ruins of the Buddhist temples
<i>Ongcor-Wat</i> and <i>Ongcor-Th&ocirc;m</i>, in Cambodia.
These splendid ruins are supposed
to be above two thousand years old: and,
at any rate, the circumstance of their age
not being known to the Cambodians suggests
a high antiquity. On the bas-reliefs
with which the temples were enriched
are figured musical instruments, which
European travellers describe as “flutes,
organs, trumpets, and drums, resembling
those of the Chinese.” Faithful sketches
of these representations might, very likely,
afford valuable hints to the student of
musical history.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Hindus.</span></h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i046" src="images/i046.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the Brahmin mythology of the
Hindus the god Nareda is the inventor
of the <i>vina</i>, the principal national instrument
of Hindustan. Saraswati, the
consort of Brahma, may be regarded as
the Minerva of the Hindus. She is the
goddess of music as well as of speech; to her is attributed the
invention of the systematic arrangement of the sounds into a
musical scale. She is represented seated on a peacock and playing
on a stringed instrument of the lute kind. Brahma himself we
find depicted as a vigorous man with four handsome heads,
beating with his hands upon a small drum; and Vishnu, in his
incarnation as Krishna, is represented as a beautiful youth playing
upon a flute. The Hindus construct a peculiar kind of flute,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
which they consider as the favourite instrument of Krishna.
They have also the divinity Ganesa, the god of Wisdom, who is
represented as a man with the head of an elephant, holding
a <i>tamboura</i> in his hands.</p>

<p>It is a suggestive fact that we find among several nations in
different parts of the world an ancient tradition, according to
which their most popular stringed instrument was originally
derived from the water.</p>

<p>In Hindu mythology the god Nareda invented the <i>vina</i>&mdash;the
principal national instrument of Hindustan&mdash;which has also the
name <i>cach’-hapi</i>, signifying a tortoise (<i>testudo</i>). Moreover, <i>nara</i>
denotes in Sanskrit water, and <i>narada</i>, or <i>nareda</i>, the giver of
water. Like Nareda, Nereus and his fifty daughters, the Nereides,
were much renowned for their musical accomplishments; and
Hermes (it will be remembered) made his lyre, the <i>chelys</i>, of
a tortoise-shell. The Scandinavian god Odin, the originator of
magic songs, is mentioned as the ruler of the sea, and as such
he had the name of <i>Nikarr</i>. In the depth of the sea he played
the harp with his subordinate spirits, who occasionally came up
to the surface of the water to teach some favoured human being
their wonderful instrument. W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, the divine player on
the Finnish <i>kantele</i> (according to the Kalewala, the old national
epic of the Finns) constructed his instrument of fish-bones. The
frame he made out of the bones of the pike; and the teeth of
the pike he used for the tuning-pegs.</p>

<p>Jacob Grimm in his work on German mythology points out
an old tradition, preserved in Swedish and Scotch national
ballads, of a skilful harper who constructs his instrument out of
the bones of a young girl drowned by a wicked woman. Her
fingers he uses for the tuning screws, and her golden hair for the
strings. The harper plays, and his music kills the murderess. A
similar story is told in the old Icelandic national songs; and the
same tradition has been preserved in the Faroe islands, as well as
in Norway and Denmark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>May not the agreeable impression produced by the rhythmical
flow of the waves and the soothing murmur of running water
have led various nations, independently of each other, to the
widespread conception that they obtained their favourite instrument
of music from the water? Or is the notion traceable to a
common source dating from a pre-historic age, perhaps from the
early period when the Aryan race is surmised to have diffused its
lore through various countries? Or did it originate in the old
belief that the world, with all its charms and delights, arose from
a chaos in which water constituted the predominant element?</p>

<p>Howbeit, Nareda, the giver of water, was evidently also the
ruler of the clouds; and Odin had his throne in the skies.
Indeed, many of the musical water-spirits appear to have been
originally considered as rain deities. Their music may therefore
be regarded as derived from the clouds rather than from the sea.
In short, the traditions respecting spirits and water are not in
contradiction to the opinion of the ancient Hindus that music is
of heavenly origin, but rather tend to support it.</p>

<p>The earliest musical instruments of the Hindus on record have,
almost all of them, remained in popular use until the present day
scarcely altered. Besides these, the Hindus possess several
Arabic and Persian instruments which are of comparatively
modern date in Hindustan: evidently having been introduced
into that country scarcely a thousand years ago, at the time of
the Mahomedan irruption. There is a treatise on music extant,
written in Sanskrit, which contains a description of the ancient
instruments. Its title is <i>S&acirc;ngita r&acirc;thnakara</i>. If, as may be
hoped, it be translated by a Sanskrit scholar who is at the same
time a good musician, we shall probably be enabled to ascertain
more exactly which of the Hindu instruments of the present day
are of comparatively modern origin.</p>

<p>The <i>vina</i> is undoubtedly of high antiquity. It has seven wire
strings, and movable frets which are generally fastened with wax.
Two hollowed gourds, often tastefully ornamented, are affixed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
it for the purpose of increasing the sonorousness. There are
several kinds of the <i>vina</i> in different districts; but that represented
in the illustration is
regarded as the oldest.
The performer
shown is Jeewan Shah,
a celebrated virtuoso
on the <i>vina</i>, who lived
about a hundred years
ago. The Hindus divided
their musical
scale into several intervals
smaller than
our modern semitones.
They adopted
twenty-two intervals
called <i>sruti</i> in the
compass of an octave,
which may therefore
be compared to our chromatic intervals. As the frets of the <i>vina</i>
are movable the performer can easily regulate them according to
the scale, or mode, which he requires for his music.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i049" src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The harp, <i>chang</i>, has become almost obsolete. If some Hindu
drawings of it can be relied upon, it had at an early time a
triangular frame and was in construction as well as in shape and
size almost identical with the Assyrian harp.</p>

<p>The Hindus claim to have invented the violin bow. They
maintain that the <i>ravanastron</i>, one of their old instruments
played with the bow, was invented about five thousand years ago
by Ravanon, a mighty king of Ceylon. However this may be
there is a great probability that the fiddle-bow originated in Hindustan;
because Sanskrit scholars inform us that there are names
for it in works which cannot be less than from 1500 to 2000 years
old. The non-occurrence of any instrument played with a bow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
on the monuments of the nations of antiquity is by no means so
sure a proof as has generally been supposed, that the bow was
unknown. The fiddle in its primitive condition must have been
a poor contrivance. It probably was despised by players who
could produce better tones with greater facility by twanging the
strings with their fingers, or with a plectrum. Thus it may have
remained through many centuries without experiencing any
material improvement. It must also be borne in mind that the
monuments transmitted to us chiefly represent historical events,
religious ceremonies, and royal entertainments. On such occasions
instruments of a certain kind only were used, and these we
find represented; while others, which may have been even more
common, never occur. In two thousand years’ time people will
possibly maintain that some highly perfected instrument popular
with them was entirely unknown to us, because it is at present in
so primitive a condition that no one hardly notices it. If the
<i>ravanastron</i> was an importation of the Mahomedans it would
most likely bear some resemblance to the Arabian and Persian
instruments, and it would be found rather in the hands of the
higher classes in the towns; whereas it is principally met with
among the lower order of people, in isolated and mountainous
districts. It is further remarkable that the most simple kind
of <i>ravanastron</i> is almost identical with the Chinese fiddle called
<i>ur-heen</i>. This species has only two strings, and its body consists of
a small block of wood, hollowed out and covered with the skin
of a serpent. The <i>ur-heen</i> has not been mentioned among the most
ancient instruments of the Chinese, since there is no evidence of
its having been known in China before the introduction of the
Buddhist religion into that country. From indications, which to
point out would lead too far here, it would appear that several
instruments found in China originated in Hindustan. They seem
to have been gradually diffused from Hindustan and Thibet, more
or less altered in the course of time, through the east as far as Japan.</p>

<p>Another curious Hindu instrument, probably of very high antiquity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
is the <i>poongi</i>, also called <i>toumrie</i> and <i>magoudi</i>. It consists
of a gourd or of the Cuddos nut, hollowed, into which two pipes
are inserted. The <i>poongi</i> therefore somewhat resembles in appearance
a bagpipe. It is generally used by the <i>Sampuris</i> or snake
charmers, who play upon it when they exhibit the antics of the
cobra. The name <i>magoudi</i>, given in certain districts to this instrument,
rather tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical
historians that the <i>magadis</i> of the ancient Greeks was a sort of
double-pipe, or bagpipe.</p>

<p>Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different names
in different districts; and, besides, there are varieties of them.
On the whole, the Hindus possess about fifty instruments. To
describe them properly would fill a volume. Some, which are in
the Kensington museum, will be found noticed in the large catalogue
of that collection.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Persians and Arabs.</span></h3>

<p>Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before the
Christian era, scarcely anything is known. It may be surmised
that they closely resembled those of the Assyrians, and probably
also those of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>The harp, <i>chang</i>, in olden time a favourite instrument of the
Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude. The illustration of
a small harp given in the woodcut
has been sketched from the celebrated
sculptures, perhaps of the sixth
century, which exist on a stupendous
rock, called Tackt-i-Bostan, in the
vicinity of the town of Kermanshah.
These sculptures are said to have
been executed during the lifetime of
the Persian monarch Khosroo Purviz.
They form the ornaments of two lofty arches, and consist of
representations of field sports and aquatic amusements. In one
of the boats is seated a man in an ornamental dress, with a halo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
round his head, who is receiving an arrow from one of his
attendants; while a female, who is sitting near him, plays on a
Trigonon. Towards the top of the bas-relief is represented a
stage, on which are performers on small straight trumpets and
little hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians, apparently
females,&mdash;the first of whom plays a flute; the second, a
sort of pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too much
defaced to be recognizable; and the fourth, a bagpipe. Two
harps of a peculiar shape were copied by Sir
Gore Ousely from Persian manuscripts about four
hundred years old resembling, in the principle on
which they are constructed, all other oriental
harps. There existed evidently various kinds of
the <i>chang</i>. It may be remarked here that the
instrument <i>tschenk</i> (or <i>chang</i>) in use at the present
day in Persia, is more like a dulcimer than a
harp. The Arabs adopted the harp from the Persians,
and called it <i>junk</i>. An interesting representation
of a Turkish woman playing the harp
(p. 53) sketched from life by Melchior Lorich in the
seventeenth century, probably exhibits an old Persian <i>chang</i>; for
the Turks derived their music principally from Persia. Here we
have an introduction into Europe of the oriental frame without a
front pillar.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i052" src="images/i052.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period,
smaller musical intervals than semitones. When the Arabs conquered
Persia (<small>A.D.</small> 641) the Persians had already attained a
higher degree of civilisation than their conquerors. The latter
found in Persia the cultivation of music considerably in advance
of their own, and the musical instruments superior also. They
soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there can be no doubt
that the musical system exhibited by the earliest Arab writers
whose works on the theory of music have been preserved was
based upon an older system of the Persians. In these works the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
octave is divided in seventeen <i>one-third-tones</i>&mdash;intervals which are
still made use of in the east. Some of the Arabian instruments
are constructed so as to enable the performer to produce
the intervals with exactness. The frets on the lute and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
tamboura, for instance, are regulated with a view to this
object.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i053" src="images/i053.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many
of the Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of
Persia. An Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares
Ben Kelde is recorded as having been sent to the Persian king
Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth century, for the purpose of learning
Persian singing and performing on the lute. Through him, it is
said, the lute was brought to Mekka. Saib Chatir, the son of
a Persian, is spoken of as the first performer on the lute in
Medina, <small>A.D.</small> 682; and of an Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch from
Mekka, <small>A.D.</small> 683, it is especially mentioned that he played in the
Persian style; evidently the superior one. The lute, <i>el-oud</i>, had
before the tenth century only four strings, or four pairs producing
four tones, each tone having two strings tuned in unison. About
the tenth century a string for a fifth tone was added. The strings
were made of silk neatly twisted. The neck of the instrument
was provided with frets of string, which were carefully regulated
according to the system of seventeen intervals in the compass of
an octave before mentioned. Other favourite stringed instruments
were the <i>tamboura</i>, a kind of lute with a long neck, and the
<i>kanoon</i>, a kind of dulcimer strung with lamb’s gut strings (generally
three in unison for each tone) and played upon with two
little plectra which the performer had fastened to his fingers. The
<i>kanoon</i> is likewise still in use in countries inhabited by Mahomedans.
The engraving, taken from a Persian painting at
Teheran, represents an old Persian <i>santir</i>, the prototype of our
dulcimer, mounted with wire strings and played upon with two
slightly curved sticks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i055" src="images/i055.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Al-Farabi, one of the earliest Arabian musical theorists known,
who lived in the beginning of the tenth century, does not allude
to the fiddle-bow. This is noteworthy inasmuch as it seems in
some measure to support the opinion maintained by some historians
that the bow originated in England or Wales. Unfortunately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
we possess no exact descriptions of the Persian and
Arabian instruments between the tenth and fourteenth centuries,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
otherwise we should probably have earlier accounts of
some instrument of the violin kind in Persia. Ash-shakandi,
who lived in Spain about <small>A.D.</small> 1200, mentions the <i>rebab</i>, which
may have been in use for centuries without having been thought
worthy of notice on account of its rudeness. Persian writers of
the fourteenth century speak of two instruments of the violin
class, viz., the <i>rebab</i> and the <i>kemangeh</i>. As
regards the <i>kemangeh</i>, the Arabs themselves
assert that they obtained it from Persia, and
their statement appears all the more worthy
of belief from the fact that both names,
<i>rebab</i> and <i>kemangeh</i>, are originally Persian.
We engrave the <i>rebab</i> from an example at
South Kensington.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i056" src="images/i056.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>nay</i>, a flute, and the <i>surnay</i>, a
species of oboe, are still popular in the east.</p>

<p>The Arabs must have been indefatigable
constructors of musical instruments. Kiesewetter
gives a list of above two hundred
names of Arabian instruments, and this does
not include many known to us through
Spanish historians. A careful investigation of the musical
instruments of the Arabs during their sojourn in Spain is
particularly interesting to the student of medi&aelig;val music, inasmuch
as it reveals the eastern origin of many instruments which
are generally regarded as European inventions. Introduced into
Spain by the Saracens and the Moors they were gradually diffused
towards northern Europe. The English, for instance, adopted
not only the Moorish dance (morrice dance) but also the <i>kuitra</i>
(gittern), the <i>el-oud</i> (lute), the <i>rebab</i> (rebec), the <i>nakkarah</i> (naker),
and several others. In an old Cornish sacred drama, supposed
to date from the fourteenth century, we have in an enumeration
of musical instruments the <i>nakrys</i>, designating “kettle-drums.” It
must be remembered that the Cornish language, which has now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
become obsolete, was nearly akin to the Welsh. Indeed, names
of musical instruments derived from the Moors in Spain occur in
almost every European language.</p>

<p>Not a few fanciful stories are traditionally preserved among
the Arabs testifying to the wonderful effects they ascribed to the
power of their instrumental performances. One example will
suffice. Al-Farabi had acquired his proficiency in Spain, in one
of the schools at Cordova which flourished as early as towards
the end of the ninth century: and his reputation became so great
that ultimately it extended to Asia. The mighty caliph of Bagdad
himself desired to hear the celebrated musician, and sent messengers
to Spain with instructions to offer rich presents to him and
to convey him to the court. But Al-Farabi feared that if he went
he should be retained in Asia, and should never again see the
home to which he felt deeply attached. At last he resolved
to disguise himself, and ventured to undertake the journey which
promised him a rich harvest. Dressed in a mean costume, he
made his appearance at the court just at the time when the caliph
was being entertained with his daily concert. Al-Farabi, unknown
to everyone, was permitted to exhibit his skill on the lute.
Scarcer had he commenced his performance in a certain musical
mode when he set all his audience laughing aloud, notwithstanding
the efforts of the courtiers to suppress so unbecoming an
exhibition of mirth in the royal presence. In truth, even the
caliph himself was compelled to burst out into a fit of laughter.
Presently the performer changed to another mode, and the effect
was that immediately all his hearers began to sigh, and soon tears
of sadness replaced the previous tears of mirth. Again he played
in another mode, which excited his audience to such a rage that
they would have fought each other if he, seeing the danger, had
not directly gone over to an appeasing mode. After this wonderful
exhibition of his skill Al-Farabi concluded in a mode which
had the effect of making his listeners fall into a profound sleep,
during which he took his departure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that this incident is almost identical with one
recorded as having happened about twelve hundred years earlier
at the court of Alexander the great, and which forms the subject of
Dryden’s “Alexander’s Feast.” The distinguished flutist Timotheus
successively aroused and subdued different passions by
changing the musical modes during his performance, exactly in
the same way as did Al-Farabi.

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The American Indians.</span></h4>

<p>If the preserved antiquities of the American Indians, dating from
a period anterior to our discovery of the western hemisphere,
possess an extraordinary interest because they afford trustworthy
evidence of the degree of progress which the aborigines had
attained in the cultivation of the arts and in their social condition
before they came in contact with Europeans, it must be admitted
that the ancient musical instruments of the American Indians are
also worthy of examination. Several of them are constructed in a
manner which, in some degree, reveals the characteristics of the
musical system prevalent among the people who used the instruments.
And although most of these interesting relics, which have
been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places, may not be of
great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily ascertained that they are
genuine contrivances of the Indians before they were influenced
by European civilization.</p>

<p>Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of
interest also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may
perhaps be found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved
problem as to the probable original connection of the American
with Asiatic races.</p>

<p>Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the
Peruvians none have been found so frequently, and have been
preserved in their former condition so unaltered, as pipes and
flutes. They are generally made of pottery or of bone, substances
which are unsuitable for the construction of most other instruments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
but which are remarkably well qualified to withstand the
decaying influence of time. There is, therefore, no reason to
conclude from the frequent occurrence of such instruments that
they were more common than other kinds of which specimens
have rarely been discovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i060" src="images/i060.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked clay,
a considerable number of which have been found. Some specimens
(of which we give engravings) are singularly grotesque in
shape, representing caricatures of the human face and figure,
birds, beasts, and flowers. Some were provided at the top with a
finger-hole which, when closed, altered the pitch of the sound, so
that two different tones were producible on the instrument.
Others had a little ball of baked clay lying loose inside the air-chamber.
When the instrument was blown the current of air set
the ball in a vibrating motion, thereby causing a shrill and whirring
sound. A similar contrivance is sometimes made use of by
Englishmen for conveying signals. The Mexican whistle most
likely served principally the same purpose, but it may possibly
have been used also in musical entertainments. In the Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
horn band each musician is restricted to a single tone; and
similar combinations of performers&mdash;only, of course, much more
rude&mdash;have been witnessed by travellers among some tribes in
Africa and America.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i061a" src="images/i061a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Rather more complete than the above specimens are some of
the whistles and small pipes which have been found in graves of
the Indians
of Chiriqui
in central
America.
The pipe or
whistle which
is represented
in the accompanying
engraving appears,
to judge from the somewhat obscure description transmitted
to us, to possess about half a dozen tones. It is of pottery, painted
in red and black on a cream-coloured ground, and in length about
five inches. Among the instruments of this kind from central
America the most complete have four finger-holes. By means
of three the following four sounds (including the sound which
is produced when none of the holes are closed) can be
emitted: <img src="images/i061b.jpg" alt="" /> the fourth finger-hole, when
closed, has the effect of lowering the pitch a semitone. By a
particular process two or three lower notes are obtainable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i062b" src="images/i062b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i062c" src="images/i062c.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The pipe of the Aztecs, which is called by the Mexican
Spaniards <i>pito</i>, somewhat resembled our flageolet: the material
was a reddish pottery, and it was provided with four finger-holes.
Although among about half a dozen specimens which
the writer has examined some are considerably larger than
others they all have, singularly enough, the same pitch of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
sound. The smallest is about six inches in length, and the
largest about nine inches. Several <i>pitos</i> have been found in a
remarkably well-preserved condition. They are easy to blow,
and their order of intervals is in conformity with the pentatonic
scale, thus: <img src="images/i062a.jpg" alt="" /> The usual shape of
the <i>pito</i> is that here represented; showing the upper side of one
pipe, and a side view of another. A specimen of a less common
shape, also engraved, is in the British museum. Indications
suggestive of the popular estimation in which the flute (or
perhaps, more strictly speaking, the pipe) was held by the Aztecs
are not wanting. It was played in religious observances and
we find it referred to allegorically in orations delivered on solemn
occasions. For instance, at the religious festival which was held
in honour of Tezcatlepoca&mdash;a divinity depicted as a handsome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
youth, and considered second only to the supreme being&mdash;a
young man was sacrificed who, in preparation for the ceremony,
had been instructed in the art of playing the flute. Twenty days
before his death four young girls, named after the principal
goddesses, were given to him as companions; and when the
hour arrived in which he was to be sacrificed he observed the
established symbolical rite of breaking a flute on each of the
steps, as he ascended the temple.</p>

<p>Again, at the public ceremonies which took place on the
accession of a prince to the throne the new monarch addressed a
prayer to the god, in which occurred the following allegorical
expression:&mdash;“I am thy flute; reveal to me thy will; breathe into
me thy breath like into a flute, as thou hast done to my predecessors
on the throne. As thou hast opened their eyes, their ears,
and their mouth to utter what is good, so likewise do to me. I
resign myself entirely to thy guidance.” Similar sentences occur
in the orations addressed to the monarch. In reading them one
can hardly fail to be reminded of Hamlet’s reflections addressed
to Guildenstern, when the servile courtier expresses his inability
to “govern the ventages” of the pipe and to make the instrument
“discourse most eloquent music,” which the prince bids him
to do.</p>

<p>M. de Castelnau in his “Exp&eacute;dition dans l’Am&eacute;rique” gives
among the illustrations of objects discovered in ancient Peruvian
tombs a flute made of a human bone. It has four finger-holes at
its upper surface and appears to have been blown into at one
end. Two bone-flutes, in appearance similar to the engraving
given by M. de Castelnau, which have been disinterred at Truxillo
are deposited in the British museum. They are about six inches
in length, and each is provided with five finger-holes. One of
these has all the holes at its upper side, and one of the holes is
considerably smaller than the rest. The specimen which we
engrave (p. 64) is ornamented with some simple designs in black.</p>

<p>The other has four holes at its upper side and one underneath,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the latter being placed near to the end at which the instrument
evidently was blown. In the aperture of this end some remains
of a hardened paste, or resinous substance, are still preserved.
This substance probably was inserted for the purpose of narrowing
the end of the tube, in order to facilitate the producing of
the sounds. The same contrivance is still resorted to in the construction
of the bone-flutes by some Indian tribes in Guiana. The
bones of slain enemies appear to have been considered especially
appropriate for such flutes. The Araucanians, having killed a
prisoner, made flutes of his bones, and danced and “thundered
out their dreadful war-songs, accompanied by the mournful sounds
of these horrid instruments.” Alonso de Ovalle says of the
Indians in Chili: “Their flutes, which they play upon in their
dances, are made of the bones of the Spaniards and other
enemies whom they have overcome in war. This they do by
way of triumph and glory for their victory. They make them
likewise of bones of animals; but the warriors dance only to the
flutes made of their enemies.” The Mexicans and Peruvians obviously
possessed a great variety of pipes and flutes, some of which
are still in use among certain Indian tribes. Those which were
found in the famous ruins at Palenque are deposited in the
museum in Mexico. They are:&mdash;The <i>cuyvi</i>, a pipe on which
only five tones were producible; the <i>huayllaca</i>, a sort of flageolet;
the <i>pincullu</i>, a flute; and the <i>chayna</i>, which is described as “a
flute whose lugubrious and melancholy tones filled the heart with
indescribable sadness, and brought involuntary tears into the
eyes.” It was perhaps a kind of oboe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i064" src="images/i064.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Peruvians had the syrinx, which they called <i>huayra-puhura</i>.
Some clue to the proper meaning of this name may perhaps be
gathered from the word <i>huayra</i>, which signifies “air.” The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
<i>huayra-puhura</i> was made of cane, and also of stone. Sometimes
an embroidery of needle-work was attached to it as an ornament.
One specimen which has been disinterred is adorned with twelve
figures precisely resembling Maltese crosses. The cross is a figure
which may readily be supposed to suggest itself very naturally;
and it is therefore not so surprising, as it may appear at a first
glance, that the American Indians used it not unfrequently in
designs and sculptures before they came in contact with
Christians.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i065a" src="images/i065a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The British museum possesses a <i>huayra-puhura</i> consisting of
fourteen reed pipes of a brownish colour, tied
together in two rows by means of thread, so as
to form a double set of seven reeds. Both sets
are almost exactly of the same dimensions and
are placed side by side. The shortest of these
reeds measure three inches, and the longest six
and a half. In one set they are open at the
bottom, and in the other they are closed. Consequently,
octaves are produced. The reader is
probably aware that the closing of a pipe at the
end raises its pitch an octave. Thus, in our organ,
the so-called stopped diapason, a set of closed
pipes, requires tubes of only half the length of
those which constitute the open diapason, although
both these stops produce tones in the same
pitch; the only difference between them being
the quality of sound, which in the former is less bright than in
the latter.</p>

<p>The tones yielded by the <i>huayra-puhura</i> in question are as
follows: <img src="images/i065b.jpg" alt="" /> The highest octave is
indistinct, owing to some injury done to the shortest tubes; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
sufficient evidence remains to show that the intervals were purposely
arranged according to the pentatonic scale. This interesting
relic was brought to light from a tomb at Arica.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i066a" src="images/i066a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another <i>huayra-puhura</i>, likewise still yielding sounds, was
discovered placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and was
procured by the French general, Paroissien. This instrument is
made of a greenish stone which is a species of talc, and contains
eight pipes. In the Berlin
museum may be seen a
good plaster cast taken
from this curious relic. The
height is 5⅜ inches, and
its width 6&frac14; inches. Four
of the tubes have small
lateral finger-holes which,
when closed, lower the
pitch a semitone. These
holes are on the second,
fourth, sixth, and seventh
pipe, as shown in the engraving. When the holes are open, the
tones are: <img src="images/i066b.jpg" alt="" /> and when they are closed:
<img src="images/i066c.jpg" alt="" /> The other tubes have unalterable tones.
The following notation exhibits all the tones producible on the
instrument:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i066d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the
Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals: it seems
rather arbitrary than premeditated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i067" src="images/i067.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If (and this seems not to be improbable) the Peruvians considered
those tones which are produced by closing the lateral
holes as additional intervals only, a variety of
scales or kinds of <i>modes</i> may have been contrived
by the admission of one or other of
these tones among the essential ones. If we
may conjecture from some remarks of Garcilasso
de la Vega, and other historians, the
Peruvians appear to have used different
orders of intervals for different kinds of tunes,
in a way similar to what we find to be the
case with certain Asiatic nations. We are
told for instance “Each poem, or song, had
its appropriate tune, and they could not put
two different songs to one tune; and this
was why the enamoured gallant, making
music at night on his flute, with the tune
which belonged to it, told the lady and all
the world the joy or sorrow of his soul, the
favour or ill-will which he possessed; so that
it might be said that he spoke by the flute.”
Thus also the Hindus have certain tunes for
certain seasons and fixed occasions, and likewise
a number of different modes or scales
used for particular kinds of songs.</p>

<p>Trumpets are often mentioned by writers
who have recorded the manners and customs
of the Indians at the time of the discovery
of America. There are, however, scarcely
any illustrations to be relied on of these instruments transmitted
to us. The Conch was frequently used as a trumpet for conveying
signals in war.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i068" src="images/i068.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The engraving represents a kind of trumpet made of wood, and
nearly seven feet in length, which Gumilla found among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Indians in the vicinity of the Orinoco. It somewhat resembles
the <i>juruparis</i>, a mysterious instrument of the Indians on the Rio
Haup&eacute;s, a tributary of the Rio Negro, south America. The
<i>juruparis</i> is regarded as an object of great veneration. Women
are never permitted to see it. So stringent is this law that any
woman obtaining a sight of it is put to death&mdash;usually by poison.
No youths are allowed to see it until they have been subjected to
a series of initiatory fastings and scourgings. The <i>juruparis</i> is
usually kept hidden in the bed of some stream, deep in the forest;
and no one dares to drink out of that sanctified stream, or to
bathe in its water. At feasts the <i>juruparis</i> is brought out during
the night, and is blown outside the houses of entertainment. The
inner portion of the instrument consists of a tube made of slips of
the Paxiaba palm (<i>Triartea exorrhiza</i>). When the Indians are
about to use the instrument they nearly close the upper end of
the tube with clay, and also tie above the oblong square hole
(shown in the engraving) a portion of the leaf of the Uaruma, one of
the arrow-root family. Round the tube are wrapped long strips
of the tough bark of the J&eacute;baru (<i>Parivoa grandiflora</i>). This
covering descends in folds below the tube. The length of
the instrument is from four to five feet. The illustration, which
exhibits the <i>juruparis</i> with its cover and without it, has been
taken from a specimen in the museum at Kew gardens. The
mysteries connected with this trumpet are evidently founded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
on an old tradition from prehistoric Indian ancestors. <i>Jurupari</i>
means “demon”; and with several Indian tribes on the Amazon
customs and ceremonies still prevail in honour of Jurupari.</p>

<p>The Caroados, an Indian tribe in Brazil, have a war trumpet
which closely resembles the <i>juruparis</i>. With this people it is the
custom for the chief to give on his war trumpet the signal for
battle, and to continue blowing as long as he wishes the battle to
last. The trumpet is made of wood, and its sound is described
by travellers as very deep but rather pleasant. The sound is
easily produced, and its continuance does not require much
exertion; but a peculiar vibration of the lips is necessary which
requires practice. Another trumpet, the <i>tur&eacute;</i>, is common with
many Indian tribes on the Amazon who use it chiefly in war.
It is made of a long and thick bamboo, and there is a split reed
in the mouthpiece. It therefore partakes rather of the character
of an oboe or clarinet. Its tone is described as loud and harsh.
The <i>tur&eacute;</i> is especially used by the sentinels of predatory hordes, who,
mounted on a lofty tree, give the signal of attack to their comrades.</p>

<p>Again, the aborigines in Mexico had a curious contrivance of
this kind, the <i>acocotl</i>, now more usually called <i>clarin</i>. The
former word is its old Indian name, and the latter appears to
have been first given to the instrument by the Spaniards. The
<i>acocotl</i> consists of a very thin tube from eight to ten feet in
length, and generally not quite straight but with some irregular
curves. This tube, which is often not thicker than a couple of
inches in diameter, terminates at one end in a sort of bell, and
has at the other end a small mouthpiece resembling in shape that
of a clarinet. The tube is made of the dry stalk of a plant which
is common in Mexico, and which likewise the Indians call <i>acocotl</i>.
The most singular characteristic of the instrument is that the performer
does not blow into it, but inhales the air through it; or
rather, he produces the sound by sucking the mouthpiece. It is
said to require strong lungs to perform on the <i>acocotl</i> effectively
according to Indian notions of taste.

<p>The <i>botuto</i>, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the
river Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples), was evidently
an ancient Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost
into oblivion during the last two centuries. It was made of baked
clay and was commonly from three to four feet long: but some
trumpets of this kind were of enormous size. The <i>botuto</i> with
two bellies was usually made thicker than that with three bellies
and emitted a deeper sound, which is described as having been
really terrific. These trumpets were used on occasions of mourning
and funeral dances. Alexander von Humboldt saw the <i>botuto</i>
among some Indian tribes near the river Orinoco.</p>

<p>Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind
instruments of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but
the descriptions given of them are too superficial to convey a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
distinct notion as to their form and purport. Several of these
barbarous contrivances scarcely deserve to be classed with musical
instruments. This may, for instance, be said of certain musical
jars or earthen vessels producing sounds, which the Peruvians
constructed for their amusement. These vessels were made
double; and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or birds.
A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chili, preserved in the
museum at Santiago, is described by the traveller S. S. Hill as
follows:&mdash;“It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our
india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from
four to six inches in length, uniting their necks near the top and
slightly curved upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side
one third of the length of the tube from one side of the necks.
To produce the sounds the bottles were filled with water and
suspended to the bough of a tree, or to a beam, by a string
attached to the middle of the curved tube, and then swung
backwards and forwards in such a manner as to cause each end
to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that the water might
pass backwards and forwards from one bottle to the other through
the tube between them. By this means soothing sounds were
produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the
drowsy chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day.
In the meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within
them diminished by evaporation, and the sound died gradually
away.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>As regards instruments of percussion, a kind of drum deserves
special notice on account of the ingenuity evinced in its construction.
The Mexicans called it <i>teponaztli</i>. They generally made it
of a single block of very hard wood, somewhat oblong square in
shape, which they hollowed, leaving at each end a solid piece
about three or four inches in thickness, and at its upper side a
kind of sound-board about a quarter of an inch in thickness. In
this sound-board, if it may be called so, they made three incisions;
namely, two running parallel some distance lengthwise of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
drum, and a third running across from one of these to the other
just in the centre. By this means they obtained two vibrating
tongues of wood which, when beaten with a stick, produced
sounds as clearly defined as are those of our kettle drums. By
making one of the tongues thinner than the other they ensured
two different sounds, the pitch of which they were enabled to
regulate by shaving off more or less of the wood. The bottom of
the drum they cut almost entirely open. The traveller, M. Nebel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
was told by arch&aelig;ologists in Mexico that these instruments always
contained the interval of a third, but on examining several specimens
which he saw in museums he found some in which the two
sounds stood towards each other in the relation of a fourth; while
in others they constituted a fifth, in others a sixth, and in some
even an octave. This is noteworthy in so far as it points to a
conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting the
seventh.</p>

<p>The <i>teponaztli</i> (engraved above) was generally carved with
various fanciful and ingenious designs. It was beaten with two
drumsticks covered at the end with an elastic gum, called <i>ule</i>,
which was obtained from the milky juice extracted from the ule-tree.
Some of these drums were small enough to be carried on a
string or strap suspended round the neck of the player; others,
again, measured upwards of five feet in length, and their sound
was so powerful that it could be heard at a distance of three
miles. In some rare instances a specimen of the <i>teponaztli</i> is still
preserved by the Indians in Mexico, especially among tribes who
have been comparatively but little affected by intercourse with
their European aggressors. Herr Heller saw such an instrument
in the hands of the Indians of Huatusco&mdash;a village near Mirador
in the Tierra templada, or temperate region, occupying the slopes
of the Cordilleras. Its sound is described as so very loud as to
be distinctly audible at an incredibly great distance. This circumstance,
which has been noticed by several travellers, may perhaps
be owing in some measure
to the condition of the atmosphere
in Mexico.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i073" src="images/i073.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Instruments of percussion constructed
on a principle more or
less similar to the <i>teponaztli</i> were
in use in several other parts of
America, as well as in Mexico.
Oviedo gives a drawing of a drum from San Domingo which, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
it shows distinctly both the upper and under side of the instrument,
is here inserted.</p>

<p>The largest kind of Mexican <i>teponaztli</i> appears to have been
generally of a cylindrical shape. Clavigero gives a drawing of
such an instrument. Drums, also, constructed of skin or parchment
in combination with wood were not unknown to the
Indians. Of this description was, for instance, the <i>huehuetl</i> of the
Aztecs in Mexico, which consisted, according to Clavigero, of a
wooden cylinder somewhat above three feet in height, curiously
carved and painted and covered at the top with carefully prepared
deer-skin. And, what appears the most remarkable, the parchment
(we are told) could be tightened or slackened by means of
cords in nearly the same way as with our own drum. The <i>huehuetl</i>
was not beaten with drumsticks but merely struck with the fingers,
and much dexterity was required to strike it in the proper manner.
Oviedo states that the Indians in Cuba had drums which were
stretched with human skin. And Bernal Diaz relates that when
he was with Cort&eacute;s in Mexico they ascended together the <i>Teocalli</i>
(“House of God”), a large temple in which human sacrifices were
offered by the aborigines; and there the Spanish visitors saw a
large drum which was made, Diaz tells us, with skins of great
serpents. This “hellish instrument,” as he calls it, produced, when
struck, a doleful sound which was so loud that it could be heard
at a distance of two leagues.</p>

<p>The name of the Peruvian drum was <i>huanca</i>: they had also
an instrument of percussion, called <i>chhilchiles</i>, which appears to
have been a sort of tambourine.</p>

<p>The rattle was likewise popular with the Indians before the
discovery of America. The Mexicans called it <i>ajacaxtli</i>. In
construction it was similar to the rattle at the present day commonly
used by the Indians. It was oval or round in shape, and
appears to have been usually made of a gourd into which holes
were pierced, and to which a wooden handle was affixed. A
number of little pebbles were enclosed in the hollowed gourd.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
They were also made of pottery. The little balls in the <i>ajacaxtli</i>
of pottery, enclosed as they are, may at a first glance appear a
puzzle. Probably, when the rattle was being formed they were
attached to the inside as slightly as possible; and after the clay
had been baked they were detached by means of an implement
passed through the holes.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i075" src="images/i075.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Tezcucans (or Acolhuans) belonged to the same race as
the Aztecs, whom they greatly surpassed in knowledge and
social refinement. Nezahualcoyotl, a wise monarch of the Tezcucans,
abhorred human sacrifices, and erected a large temple which
he dedicated to “The unknown god, the cause of causes.” This
edifice had a tower nine stories high, on the top of which were
placed a number of musical instruments of various kinds which
were used to summon the worshippers to prayer. Respecting
these instruments especial mention is made of a sonorous metal
which was struck with a mallet. This is stated in a historical
essay written by Ixtlilxochitl, a native of Mexico and of royal
descent, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
and who may be supposed to have been familiar with the musical
practices of his countrymen. But whether the sonorous metal
alluded to was a gong or a bell is
not clear from the vague record
transmitted to us. That the bell
was known to the Peruvians appears
to be no longer doubtful,
since a small copper specimen
has been found in one of the old
Peruvian tombs. This interesting
relic is now deposited in the
museum at Lima. M. de Castelnau
has published a drawing of
it, which is here reproduced. The
Peruvians called their bells <i>chanrares</i>; it remains questionable
whether this name did not designate rather the so-called horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
bells, which were certainly known to the Mexicans who called
them <i>yotl</i>. It is noteworthy that these <i>yotl</i> are found figured in
the picture-writings representing the various
objects which the Aztecs used to pay as
tribute to their sovereigns. The collection
of Mexican antiquities in the British museum
contains a cluster of yotl-bells. Being nearly
round, they closely resemble the <i>Schellen</i>
which the Germans are in the habit of
affixing to their horses, particularly in the
winter when they are driving their noiseless
sledges.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i076" src="images/i076.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Again, in south America sonorous stones
are not unknown, and were used in olden
time for musical purposes. The traveller
G. T. Vigne saw among the Indian antiquities
preserved in the town of Cuzco, in
Peru, “a musical instrument of green sonorous
stone, about a foot long, and an inch
and a half wide, flat-sided, pointed at both
ends, and arched at the back, where it was about a quarter
of an inch thick, whence it diminished to an edge, like the
blade of a knife.... In the middle of the back was a
small hole, through which a piece of string was passed; and when
suspended and struck by any hard substance a singularly musical
note was produced.” Humboldt mentions the Amazon-stone,
which on being struck by any hard substance yields a metallic sound.
It was formerly cut by the American Indians into very thin plates,
perforated in the centre and suspended by a string. These plates
were remarkably sonorous. This kind of stone is not, as might
be conjectured from its name, found exclusively near the Amazon.
The name was given to it as well as to the river by the first
European visitors to America, in allusion to the female warriors
respecting whom strange stories are told. The natives pretending,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
according to an ancient tradition, that the stone came from the
country of “Women without husbands,” or “Women living alone.”</p>

<p>As regards the ancient stringed instruments of the American
Indians our information is indeed but scanty. Clavigero says
that the Mexicans were entirely unacquainted with stringed
instruments: a statement the correctness of which is questionable,
considering the stage of civilization to which these people
had attained. At any rate, we generally find one or other kind of
such instruments with nations whose intellectual progress and
social condition are decidedly inferior. The Aztecs had many
claims to the character of a civilized community and (as before said)
the Tezcucans were even more advanced in the cultivation of the
arts and sciences than the Aztecs. “The best histories,” Prescott
observes, “the best poems, the best code of laws, the purest
dialect, were all allowed to be Tezcucan. The Aztecs rivalled
their neighbours in splendour of living, and even in the magnificence
of their structures. They displayed a pomp and ostentatious
pageantry, truly Asiatic.” Unfortunately historians are sometimes
not sufficiently discerning in their communications respecting
musical questions. J. Ranking, in describing the grandeur of the
establishment maintained by Montezuma, says that during the
repasts of this monarch “there was music of fiddle, flute, snail-shell,
a kettle-drum, and other strange instruments.” But as this
writer does not indicate the source whence he drew his information
respecting Montezuma’s orchestra including the fiddle, the
assertion deserves scarcely a passing notice.</p>

<p>The Peruvians possessed a stringed instrument, called <i>tinya</i>,
which was provided with five or seven strings. To conjecture
from the unsatisfactory account of it transmitted to us, the <i>tinya</i>
appears to have been a kind of guitar. Considering the fragility
of the materials of which such instruments are generally constructed,
it is perhaps not surprising that we do not meet with
any specimens of them in the museums of American antiquities.</p>

<p>A few remarks will not be out of place here referring to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
musical performances of the ancient Indians; since an acquaintance
with the nature of the performances is likely to afford additional
assistance in appreciating the characteristics of the instruments.
In Peru, where the military system was carefully organised,
each division of the army had its trumpeters, called <i>cqueppacamayo</i>,
and its drummers, called <i>huancarcamayo</i>. When the Inca returned
with his troops victorious from battle his first act was to repair to
the temple of the Sun in order to offer up thanksgiving; and
after the conclusion of this ceremony the people celebrated the
event with festivities, of which music and dancing constituted
a principal part. Musical performances appear to have
been considered indispensable on occasions of public celebrations;
and frequent mention is made of them by historians who
have described the festivals annually observed by the Peruvians.</p>

<p>About the month of October the Peruvians celebrated a solemn
feast in honour of the dead, at which ceremony they executed
lugubrious songs and plaintive instrumental music. Compositions
of a similar character were performed on occasion of the decease
of a monarch. As soon as it was made known to the people that
their Inca had been “called home to the mansions of his father
the sun” they prepared to celebrate his obsequies with becoming
solemnity. Prescott, in his graphic description of these observances,
says: “At stated intervals, for a year, the people assembled
to renew the expressions of their sorrow; processions were
made displaying the banner of the departed monarch; bards and
minstrels were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their
songs continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence
of the reigning monarch,&mdash;thus stimulating the living by
the glorious example of the dead.” The Peruvians had also particular
agricultural songs, which they were in the habit of singing
while engaged in tilling the lands of the Inca; a duty which
devolved upon the whole nation. The subject of these songs, or
rather hymns, referred especially to the noble deeds and glorious
achievements of the Inca and his dynasty. While thus singing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the labourers regulated their work to the rhythm of the music,
thereby ensuring a pleasant excitement and a stimulant in their
occupation, like soldiers regulating their steps to the music of the
military band. These hymns pleased the Spanish invaders so
greatly that they not only adopted several of them but also composed
some in a similar form and style. This appears, however,
to have been the case rather with the poetry than with the
music.</p>

<p>The name of the Peruvian elegiac songs was <i>haravi</i>. Some
tunes of these songs, pronounced to be genuine specimens, have
been published in recent works; but their genuineness is questionable.
At all events they must have been much tampered
with, as they exhibit exactly the form of the Spanish <i>bolero</i>. Even
allowing that the melodies of these compositions have been
derived from Peruvian <i>harivaris</i>, it is impossible to determine
with any degree of certainty how much in them has been retained
of the original tunes, and how much has been supplied besides
the harmony, which is entirely an addition of the European
arranger. The Peruvians had minstrels, called <i>haravecs</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, “inventors”),
whose occupation it was to compose and to recite the
<i>haravis</i>.</p>

<p>The Mexicans possessed a class of songs which served as a
record of historical events. Furthermore they had war-songs,
love-songs, and other secular vocal compositions, as well as
sacred chants, in the practice of which boys were instructed by
the priests in order that they might assist in the musical performances
of the temple. It appertained to the office of the
priests to burn incense, and to perform music in the temple at
stated times of the day. The commencement of the religious
observances which took place regularly at sunrise, at mid-day,
at sunset, and at midnight, was announced by signals blown on
trumpets and pipes. Persons of high position retained in their
service professional musicians whose duty it was to compose
ballads, and to perform vocal music with instrumental accompaniment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
The nobles themselves, and occasionally even the
monarch, not unfrequently delighted in composing ballads and
odes.</p>

<p>Especially to be noticed is the institution termed “Council of
music,” which the wise monarch Nezahualcoyotl founded in
Tezcuco. This institution was not intended exclusively for promoting
the cultivation of music; its aim comprised the advancement
of various arts, and of sciences such as history, astronomy,
&amp;c. In fact, it was an academy for general education.
Probably no better evidence could be cited testifying to the
remarkable intellectual attainments of the Mexican Indians before
the discovery of America than this council of music. Although
in some respects it appears to have resembled the board of music
of the Chinese, it was planned on a more enlightened and more
comprehensive principle. The Chinese “board of music,” called
<i>Yo Poo</i>, is an office connected with the <i>L&eacute; Poo</i> or “board of
rites,” established by the imperial government at Peking. The
principal object of the board of rites is to regulate the ceremonies
on occasions of sacrifices offered to the gods; of festivals and
certain court solemnities; of military reviews; of presentations,
congratulations, marriages, deaths, burials,&mdash;in short, concerning
almost every possible event in social and public life.</p>

<p>The reader is probably aware that in one of the various hypotheses
which have been advanced respecting the Asiatic origin
of the American Indians China is assigned to them as their
ancient home. Some historians suppose them to be emigrants
from Mongolia, Thibet, or Hindustan; others maintain that they
are the offspring of Phœnician colonists who settled in central
America. Even more curious are the arguments of certain
inquirers who have no doubt whatever that the ancestors of the
American Indians were the lost ten tribes of Israel, of whom
since about the time of the Babylonian captivity history is silent.
Whatever may be thought as to which particular one of these
speculations hits the truth, they certainly have all proved useful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
in so far as they have made ethnologists more exactly acquainted
with the habits and predilections of the American aborigines than
would otherwise have been the case. For, as the advocates of
each hypothesis have carefully collected and adduced every
evidence they were able to obtain tending to support their
views, the result is that (so to say) no stone has been left unturned.
Nevertheless, any such hints as suggest themselves
from an examination of musical instruments have hitherto remained
unheeded. It may therefore perhaps interest the reader
to have his attention drawn to a few suggestive similarities occurring
between instruments of the American Indians and of certain
nations inhabiting the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Mexican pipe and the Peruvian syrinx
were purposely constructed so as to produce the intervals of the
pentatonic scale only. There are some additional indications of
this scale having been at one time in use with the American
Indians. For instance, the music of the Peruvian dance <i>cachua</i>
is described as having been very similar to some Scotch national
dances; and the most conspicuous characteristics of the Scotch
tunes are occasioned by the frequently exclusive employment of
intervals appertaining to the pentatonic scale. We find precisely
the same series of intervals adopted on certain Chinese instruments,
and evidences are not wanting of the pentatonic scale having
been popular among various races in Asia at a remote period.
The series of intervals appertaining to the Chiriqui pipe, mentioned
page 61, consisted of a semitone and two whole tones, like the
<i>tetrachord</i> of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>In the Peruvian <i>huayra-puhura</i> made of talc some of the pipes
possess lateral holes. This contrivance, which is rather unusual,
occurs on the Chinese <i>cheng</i>. The <i>chayna</i>, mentioned page 64,
seems to have been provided with a reed, like the oboe: and in
Hindustan we find a species of oboe called <i>shehna</i>. The <i>tur&eacute;</i> of
the Indian tribes on the Amazon, mentioned page 69, reminds us
of the trumpets <i>tooree</i>, or <i>tootooree</i>, of the Hindus. The name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
appears to have been known also to the Arabs; but there is no
indication whatever of its having been transmitted to the peninsula
by the Moors, and afterwards to south America by the
Portuguese and Spaniards.</p>

<p>The wooden tongues in the drum <i>teponaztli</i> may be considered
as a contrivance exclusively of the ancient American Indians.
Nevertheless a construction nearly akin to it may be observed in
certain drums of the Tonga and Feejee islanders, and of the
natives of some islands in Torres strait. Likewise some negro
tribes in western and central Africa have certain instruments
of percussion which are constructed on a principle somewhat
reminding us of the <i>teponaztli</i>. The method of bracing the drum
by means of cords, as exhibited in the <i>huehueil</i> of the Mexican
Indians, is evidently of very high antiquity in the east. It was
known to the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>Rattles, pandean pipes made of reed, and conch trumpets, are
found almost all over the world, wherever the materials of which
they are constructed are easily obtainable. Still, it may be
noteworthy that the Mexicans employed the conch trumpet in
their religious observances apparently in much the same way as it
is used in the Buddhist worship of the Thibetans and Kalmuks.</p>

<p>As regards the sonorous metal in the great temple at Tezcuco
some inquirers are sure that it was a gong: but it must be borne
in mind that these inquirers detect everywhere traces proving an
invasion of the Mongols, which they maintain to have happened
about six hundred years ago. Had they been acquainted with the
little Peruvian bell (engraved on page 75) they would have had
more tangible musical evidence in support of their theory than
the supposed gong; for this bell certainly bears a suggestive
resemblance to the little hand-bell which the Buddhists use in
their religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>The Peruvians interpolated certain songs, especially those
which they were in the habit of singing while cultivating the
fields, with the word <i>hailli</i> which signified “Triumph.” As the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
subject of these compositions was principally the glorification of
the Inca, the burden <i>hailli</i> is perhaps all the more likely to
remind Europeans of the Hebrew <i>hallelujah</i>. Moreover, Adair,
who lived among the Indians of north America during a period of
about forty years, speaks of some other words which he found
used as burdens in hymns sung on solemn occasions, and which
appeared to him to correspond with certain Hebrew words of a
sacred import.</p>

<p>As regards the musical accomplishments of the Indian tribes at
the present day they are far below the standard which we have
found among their ancestors. A period of three hundred years of
oppression has evidently had the effect of subduing the melodious
expressions of happiness and contentedness which in former times
appear to have been quite as prevalent with the Indians as they
generally are with independent and flourishing nations. The
innate talent for music evinced by those of the North American
Indians who were converted to Christianity soon after the emigration
of the puritans to New England is very favourably
commented on by some old writers. In the year 1661 John Elliot
published a translation of the psalms into Indian verse. The
singing of these metrical psalms by the Indian converts in their
places of worship appears to have been actually superior to the
sacred vocal performances of their Christian brethren from
Europe; for we find it described by several witnesses as
“excellent” and “most ravishing.”</p>

<p>In other parts of America the catholic priests from Spain did
not neglect to turn to account the susceptibility of the Indians for
music. Thus, in central America the Dominicans composed as
early as in the middle of the sixteenth century a sacred poem in
the Guatemalian dialect containing a narrative of the most
important events recorded in the Bible. This production they
sang to the natives, and to enhance the effect they accompanied
the singing with musical instruments. The alluring music soon
captivated the heart of a powerful cazique, who was thus induced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
to adopt the doctrines embodied in the composition, and to
diffuse them among his subjects who likewise delighted in the
performances. In Peru a similar experiment, resorted to by the
priests who accompanied Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally
successful. They dramatized certain scenes in the life of Christ
and represented them with music, which so greatly fascinated the
Indians that many of them readily embraced the new faith. Nor
are these entertainments dispensed with even at the present day
by the Indian Christians, especially in the village churches of the
Sierra in Peru; and as several religious ceremonies have been
retained by these people from their heathen forefathers, it may be
conjectured that their sacred musical performances also retain
much of their ancient heathen character.</p>

<p>Most of the musical instruments found among the American
Indians at the present day are evidently genuine old Indian
contrivances as they existed long before the discovery of America.
Take, for example, the peculiarly shaped rattles, drums, flutes,
and whistles of the North American Indians, of which some
specimens in the Kensington museum are described in the large
catalogue. A few African instruments, introduced by the negro
slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands of the Indians,
and have been by some travellers erroneously described as
genuine Indian inventions. This is the case with the African
<i>marimba</i>, which has become rather popular with the natives of
Guatemala in central America: but such adaptations are very
easily discernible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">European Nations during the Middle Ages.</span></h3>

<p>Many representations of musical instruments of the middle ages
have been preserved in manuscripts, as well as in sculptures and
paintings forming ornamental portions of churches and other
buildings. Valuable facts and hints are obtainable from these
evidences, provided they are judiciously selected and carefully
examined. The subject is, however, so large that only a few
observations on the most interesting instruments can be offered
here. Unfortunately there still prevails much uncertainty respecting
several of the earliest representations as to the precise century
from which they date, and there is reason to believe that in some
instances the arch&aelig;ological zeal of musical investigators has
assigned a higher antiquity to such discoveries than can be
satisfactorily proved.</p>

<p>It appears certain that the most ancient European instruments
known to us were in form and construction more like the Asiatic
than was the case with later ones. Before a nation has attained to a
rather high degree of civilisation its progress in the cultivation of
music, as an art, is very slow indeed. The instruments found at
the present day in Asia are scarcely superior to those which were
in use among oriental nations about three thousand years ago. It
is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that no material improvement
is perceptible in the construction of the instruments of European
countries during the lapse of nearly a thousand years. True,
evidences to be relied on referring to the first five or six centuries
of the Christian era are but scanty; although indications are not
wanting which may help the reflecting musician.

<p>There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from
the fourth century in which the lyre is represented. In one of
them Christ is depicted as Apollo touching the lyre. This
instrument occurs at an early period in western Europe as used in
popular pastimes. In an Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth
century in the British museum (Cleopatra C. VIII.) are the
figures of two gleemen, one playing the lyre and the other a
double-pipe. M. de Coussemaker has published in the “Annales
Arch&eacute;ologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing the
lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth
century in the library at Angers. The player twangs the strings
with his fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned
uses a plectrum.</p>

<p><i>Cithara</i> was a name
applied to several stringed
instruments greatly varying
in form, power of
sound, and compass. The illustration represents a cithara from
a manuscript of the
ninth century, formerly
in the library of the
great monastery of St.
Blasius in the Black
Forest. When in the
year 1768 the monastery
was destroyed by
fire, this valuable book
perished in the flames;
fortunately the celebrated
abbot Gerbert
possessed tracings of
the illustrations, which
were saved from destruction. He published them, in the
year 1774, in his work “De cantu et musica sacra.” Several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
illustrations in the following pages, it will be seen, have been
derived from this interesting source. As the older works
on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn
from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers
merely adopted such Latin names as they thought the most
appropriate. Thus, for instance, a very simple stringed instrument
of a triangular
shape, and a somewhat
similar one of
a square shape were
designated by the
name of <i>psalterium</i>;
and we further give a
woodcut of the square
kind (p. 86), and of a <i>cithara</i> (above) from the same manuscript.</p>

</div>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i087b" src="images/i087b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This last instrument is evidently an improvement upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
triangular psalterium, because it has a sort of small sound-board at
the top. Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have
been the instrument designated as <i>nablum</i>, which we engrave
(p. 87) from a manuscript of the ninth century at Angers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i088" src="images/i088.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was
apparently the prototype of the <i>citole</i>; a kind of dulcimer which
was played with the fingers. The names were not only often
vaguely applied by the medi&aelig;val writers but they changed also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
in almost every century. The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian
<i>salterio</i>, English <i>psaltery</i>), of the fourteenth century and later had
the trapezium shape of the dulcimer.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i089" src="images/i089.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions
with a harp, more or less triangular in shape,&mdash;an instrument
which may be considered
rather as constituting the
transition of the lyre into
the harp. The representation
of king David playing
the harp is from an
Anglo-saxon manuscript
of the beginning of the
eleventh century, in the
British museum. The
harp was especially popular
in central and northern
Europe, and was the
favourite instrument of
the German and Celtic
bards and of the Scandinavian
skalds. In the
next illustration from the
manuscript of the monastery
of St. Blasius twelve
strings and two sound holes are given to it. A harp similar in
form and size, but without the front pillar, was known to the
ancient Egyptians. Perhaps the addition was also non-existent
in the earliest specimens appertaining to European nations; and
a sculptured figure of a small harp constructed like the ancient
eastern harp has been discovered in the old church of Ullard in the
county of Kilkenny. Of this curious relic, which is said to date
from a period anterior to the year 800, a fac-simile taken from
Bunting’s “Ancient Music of Ireland” is given (p. 91). As Bunting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
was the first who drew attention to this sculpture his account of it
may interest the reader. “The drawing” he says “is taken from
one of the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the old
church of Ullard. From the style of the workmanship, as well as
from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older than the similar
monument at Monasterboice which is known to have been set up
before the year 830. The sculpture is rude; the circular rim
which binds the arms of the cross together is not pierced in the
quadrants, and many of the figures originally in relievo are now
wholly abraded. It is difficult to determine whether the number
of strings represented is six or seven; but, as has been already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be expected either in
sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The Finns
had a harp (<i>harpu</i>, <i>kantele</i>) with a
similar frame, devoid of a front pillar,
still in use until the commencement of
the present century.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting stringed
instruments of the middle ages is the
<i>rotta</i> (German, <i>rotte</i>; English, <i>rote</i>). It
was sounded by twanging the strings,
and also by the application of the bow.
The first method was, of course, the
elder one. There can hardly be a doubt
that when the bow came into use it was
applied to certain popular instruments
which previously had been treated like
the <i>cithara</i> or the <i>psalterium</i>. The
Hindus at the present day use their <i>suroda</i> sometimes as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
lute and sometimes as a fiddle. In some measure we do the
same with the violin by playing occasionally <i>pizzicato</i>. The <i>rotta</i>
(shown p. 91) from the manuscript of St. Blasius is called
in Gerbert’s work <i>cithara teutonica</i>, while the harp is called
<i>cithara anglica</i>; from which
it would appear that the
former was regarded as pre-eminently
a German instrument.
Possibly its name
may have been originally
<i>chrotta</i> and the continental
nations may have adopted it
from the Celtic races of the
British isles, dropping the
guttural sound. This hypothesis
is, however, one of
those which have been advanced
by some musical historians
without any satisfactory
evidence.</p>

</div>

<p>We engrave also another
representation of David playing
on the <i>rotta</i>, from a
psalter of the seventh century
in the British museum (Cott.
Vesp. A. I). According to
tradition, this psalter is one
of the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St.
Augustine. The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand
of the musician (see p. 22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the
time of Joseph. In the <i>rotta</i> the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to
be recognized. An illumination of king David playing the <i>rotta</i>
forms the frontispiece of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved
in the cathedral library of Durham; and which is musically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
interesting inasmuch as it represents a <i>rotta</i> of an oblong
square shape like that just noticed and resembling the Welsh
<i>crwth</i>. It has only five strings which the performer twangs with
his fingers. Again, a very interesting representation (which we
engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of <i>rotta</i> occurs in a manuscript
of the tenth century,
in the British museum (Vitellius
F. XI.). The manuscript
has been much injured
by a fire in the year
1731, but Professor Westwood
has succeeded, with
great care, and with the aid
of a magnifying glass, in
making out the lines of the
figure. As it has been ascertained
that the psalter is
written in the Irish semi-uncial
character it is highly
probable that the kind of
<i>rotta</i> represents the Irish
<i>cionar cruit</i>, which was
played by twanging the
strings and also by the application
of a bow. Unfortunately
we possess no
well-authenticated representation
of the Welsh
<i>crwth</i> of an early period;
otherwise we should in all
probability find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum.
Venantius Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second
half of the sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta
Britanna.” He does not, however, allude to the bow, and there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
is no reason to suppose that it existed in England. Howbeit,
the Welsh <i>crwth</i> (Anglo-saxon, <i>crudh</i>; English, <i>crowd</i>) is only
known as a species of fiddle closely resembling the <i>rotta</i>, but
having a finger-board in the middle of the open frame and being
strung with only a few strings; while the <i>rotta</i> had sometimes
above twenty strings. As it may interest the reader to examine
the form of the modern <i>crwth</i> we
give a woodcut of it. Edward
Jones, in his “Musical and poetical
relicks of the Welsh bards,” records
that the Welsh had before this kind
of <i>crwth</i> a three-stringed one called
“Crwth Trithant,” which was, he
says, “a sort of violin, or more properly
a rebeck.” The three-stringed
<i>crwth</i> was chiefly used by the inferior
class of bards; and was probably
the Moorish fiddle which is
still the favourite instrument of the
itinerant bards of the Bretons in
France, who call it <i>r&eacute;bek</i>. The Bretons,
it will be remembered, are
close kinsmen of the Welsh.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i094" src="images/i094.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A player on the <i>crwth</i> or <i>crowd</i>
(a crowder) from a bas-relief on the
under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester cathedral
(engraved p. 95) dates from the twelfth or thirteenth century; and
we give (p. 96) a copy of an illumination from a manuscript in the
Biblioth&egrave;que royale at Paris of the eleventh century. The player
wears a crown on his head; and in the original some musicians
placed at his side are performing on the psalterium and other
instruments. These last are figured with uncovered heads;
whence M. de Coussemaker concludes that the <i>crout</i> was considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
by the artist who drew the figures as the noblest instrument.
It was probably identical with the <i>rotta</i> of the same century on
the continent.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i095" src="images/i095.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An interesting drawing of an Anglo-saxon fiddle&mdash;or <i>fithele</i>, as
it was called&mdash;is given in a
manuscript of the eleventh
century in the British museum
(Cotton, Tiberius, c. 6). The
instrument is of a pear shape,
with four strings, and the
bridge is not indicated. A
German fiddle of the ninth
century, called <i>lyra</i>, copied
by Gerbert from the manuscript
of St. Blasius, has only
one string. These are shown in
the woodcuts (p. 97). Other
records of the employment of
the fiddle-bow in Germany in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are not wanting. For instance,
in the famous ‘Nibelungenlied’ Volker is described as wielding
the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword. And in
‘Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense’ of the year 1203, the following
miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred in the
village of Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsun-week, while the
parson was fiddling to his peasants who were dancing, there
came a flash of lightning and struck the parson’s arm which
held the fiddle-bow, and killed twenty-four people on the
spot.”</p>

<p>Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments
of the violin kind found in England those deserve to be noticed
which are painted on the interior of the roof of Peterborough
cathedral. They are said to date from the twelfth century. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of these figures is particularly interesting on account of the surprising
resemblance which his instrument bears to our present
violin. Not only the incurvations on the sides of the body but
also the two sound-holes are nearly identical in shape with those
made at the present day. Respecting the reliance to be placed
on such evidence, it is
necessary to state that
the roof, originally constructed
between the
years 1177 and 1194,
was thoroughly repaired
in the year 1835. Although
we find it asserted
that “the greatest
care was taken to retain
every part, or to restore
it to its original state,
so that the figures, even
where retouched, are in
effect the same as when
first painted,” it nevertheless
remains a debatable
question whether
the restorers have not
admitted some slight
alterations, and have
thereby somewhat modernised
the appearance
of the instruments. A
slight touch with the
brush at the sound-holes, the screws, or the curvatures, would
suffice to produce modifications which might to the artist appear
as being only a renovation of the original representation, but
which to the musical investigator greatly impair the value of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
evidence. Sculptures are, therefore, more to be relied upon in
evidence than frescoes.</p>

<p>The construction of the <i>organistrum</i> requires but little explanation.
A glance at the finger-board reveals at once that the
different tones were obtained by raising the keys placed on the
neck under the strings, and that the keys were raised by means of
the handles at the side of the neck. Of the two bridges shown on
the body, the one situated nearest the middle was formed by a
wheel in the inside, which projected through the sound-board.
The wheel which slightly touched the strings vibrated them by
friction when turned by the handle at the end. The order of
intervals was <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b-flat</i>, <i>b-natural</i>, <i>c</i>, and were obtainable
on the highest string. There is reason to suppose that the other
two strings were generally tuned a fifth and an octave below the
highest. The <i>organistrum</i> may be regarded as the predecessor of
the hurdy-gurdy, and was a rather cumbrous contrivance. Two
persons seem to have been required to sound it, one to turn the
handle and the other to manage the keys. Thus it is generally
represented in medi&aelig;val concerts.</p>

<p>The <i>monochord</i> (p. 100) was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box. The string
could be tightened or slackened by means of a turning screw
inserted into one end of the box. The intervals of the scale were
marked on the side, and were regulated by a sort of movable bridge
placed beneath the string when required. As might be expected, the
<i>monochord</i> was chiefly used by theorists; for any musical performance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
it was but little suitable. About
a thousand years ago when this
monochord was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the exception
of the interval of the seventh,
which was chromatic inasmuch as
both <i>b-flat</i> and <i>b-natural</i> formed part
of the scale. The notation on the
preceding page exhibits the compass
as well as the order of intervals
adhered to about the tenth
century.</p>

<p>This ought to be borne in mind
in examining the representations of
musical instruments transmitted to
us from that period.</p>

<p>As regards the wind instruments
popular during the middle ages,
some were of quaint form as well as
of rude construction.</p>

<p>The <i>chorus</i>, or <i>choron</i>, had either
one or two tubes, as in the woodcut
page 101. There were several varieties
of this instrument; sometimes it
was constructed with a bladder into
which the tube is inserted; this kind
of <i>chorus</i> resembled the bagpipe;
another kind resembled the <i>poongi</i>
of the Hindus, mentioned page 51.
The name <i>chorus</i> was also applied
to certain stringed instruments.
One of these had much the form of
the <i>cithara</i>, page 86. It appears
however, probable that <i>chorus</i> or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
<i>choron</i> originally designated a horn (Hebrew, <i>Keren</i>; Greek,
<i>Keras</i>; Latin, <i>cornu</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i100" src="images/i100.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet. Of the <i>syrinx</i> there are extant some illustrations of the
ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a
number of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in
use. In one specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the
eleventh century the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box.
This is probably the <i>frestele</i>, <i>fretel</i>, or <i>fretiau</i>, which in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries was in favour with the French m&eacute;n&eacute;triers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript
of the eighth century in the British museum. The largest kind
of trumpet was placed on a stand when blown. Of the <i>oliphant</i>,
or hunting horn, some fine specimens are in the South Kensington
collection. The <i>sackbut</i> (of which we give a woodcut) probably
made of metal, could be
drawn out to alter the
pitch of sound. The
sackbut of the ninth
century had, however, a
very different shape to
that in use about three
centuries ago, and much more resembled the present <i>trombone</i>.
The name <i>sackbut</i> is supposed to be a corruption of <i>sambuca</i>.
The French, about the fifteenth century, called it <i>sacqueboute</i> and
<i>saquebutte</i>.</p>

<p>The most important wind instrument&mdash;in fact, the king of all
the musical instruments&mdash;is the organ.</p>

<p>The <i>pneumatic organ</i> is sculptured on an obelisk which was
erected in Constantinople under Theodosius the great, towards
the end of the fourth century. The bellows were pressed by men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
standing on them: see page 103. This interesting monument also
exhibits performers on the double flute. The <i>hydraulic organ</i>, which
is recorded to have been already known about two hundred years
before the Christian era, was according to some statements occasionally
employed in churches during the earlier centuries of the
middle ages. Probably it was more frequently heard in secular
entertainments for which it was more suitable; and at the beginning
of the fourteenth century appears to have been entirely
supplanted by the pneumatic organ. The earliest organs had only
about a dozen pipes. The largest, which were made about nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
hundred years ago, had only three octaves, in which the chromatic
intervals did not occur. Some progress in the construction of the
organ is exhibited in an illustration (engraved
p. 104) dating from the twelfth century, in a
psalter of Eadwine, in the library of Trinity
college, Cambridge. The instrument has
ten pipes, or perhaps fourteen, as four of
them appear to be double pipes. It required
four men exerting all their power to
produce the necessary wind, and two men to
play the instrument. Moreover, both players
seem also to be busily engaged in directing
the blowers about the proper supply of
wind. Six men and only fourteen pipes!
It must be admitted that since the twelfth
century some progress has been made, at
all events, in the construction of the organ.</p>

<p>The pedal is generally believed to have
been invented by Bernhard, a German, who
lived in Venice about the year 1470. There
are, however, indications extant pointing to
an earlier date of its invention. Perhaps
Bernhard was the first who, by adopting a
more practicable construction, made the
pedal more generally known. On the earliest
organs the keys of the finger-board
were of enormous size, compared with those
of the present day; so that a finger-board
with only nine keys had a breadth of from
four to five feet. The organist struck the
keys down with his fist, as is done in playing
the <i>carillon</i> still in use on the continent, of
which presently some account will be given.</p>

<p>Of the little portable organ, known as the <i>regal</i> or <i>regals</i>, often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting sculptured representations
are still extant in the old ecclesiastical edifices of
England and Scotland. There is, for instance, in Beverley minster
a figure of a man playing on a
single regal, or a regal provided
with only one set of pipes; and
in Melrose abbey the figure of
an angel holding in his arms a
double regal, the pipes of which
are in two sets. The regal
generally had keys like those of
the organ but smaller. A
painting in the national Gallery,
by Melozzo da Forli who lived
in the fifteenth century, contains
a regal which has keys of a
peculiar shape, rather resembling
the pistons of certain brass instruments.
The illustration has been drawn from that painting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to mention that the
name <i>regal</i> (or <i>regals</i>, <i>rigols</i>) was also applied to an instrument
of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood. This contrivance
was, in short, a kind of harmonica, resembling in shape
as well as in the principle of its construction the little glass
harmonica, a mere toy, in which slips of glass are arranged
according to our musical scale. In England it appears to have
been still known in the beginning of the eighteenth century.
Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of musical instrument
consisting of several sticks bound together, only separated
by beads. It makes a tolerable harmony, being well struck with
a ball at the end of a stick.” In the earlier centuries of the
middle ages there appear to have been some instruments of
percussion in favour, to which Grassineau’s expression “a tolerable
harmony” would scarcely have been applicable. Drums, of
course, were known; and their rhythmical noise must have been
soft music, compared with the shrill sounds of the <i>cymbalum</i>;
a contrivance consisting of a number of metal plates suspended
on cords, so that they could be clashed together simultaneously;
or with the clangour of the <i>cymbalum</i> constructed with bells
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
instead of plates; or with the piercing noise of the <i>bunibulum</i>, or
<i>bombulom</i>; an instrument which consisted of an angular frame to
which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes and
sizes. The lower part of the frame constituted the handle: and
to produce the noise it evidently was shaken somewhat like the
sistrum of the ancient Egyptians. We give woodcuts of the
three instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i105" src="images/i105.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>triangle</i> nearly resembled the instrument of this name in
use at the present day; it was more elegant in shape and had
some metal ornamentation in the middle.</p>

<p>The <i>tintinnabulum</i> consisted of a number of bells arranged in
regular order and suspended in a frame.</p>

<p>Respecting the orchestras, or musical bands, represented on
monuments of the middle ages, there can hardly be a doubt that
the artists who sculptured them were not unfrequently led by their
imagination rather than by an adherence to actual fact. It is,
however, not likely that they introduced into such representations
instruments that were never admitted in the orchestras, and which
would have appeared inappropriate to the contemporaries of the
artists. An examination of one or two of the orchestras may
therefore find a place here, especially as they throw some additional
light upon the characteristics of the instrumental music of
medi&aelig;val time.</p>

<p>A very interesting group of music performers dating, it is said,
from the end of the eleventh century is preserved in a bas-relief
which formerly ornamented the abbey of St. Georges de Boscherville
and which is now removed to the museum of Rouen. The
orchestra comprises twelve performers, most of whom wear a
crown. The first of them plays upon a viol, which he holds
between his knees as the violoncello is held. His instrument
is scarcely as large as the smallest viola da gamba. By
his side are a royal lady and her attendant, the former playing
on an <i>organistrum</i> of which the latter is turning the
wheel. Next to these is represented a performer on a <i>syrinx</i>
of the kind shown in the engraving p. 112; and next to him a
performer on a stringed instrument resembling a lute, which,
however, is too much dilapidated to be recognisable. Then we
have a musician with a small stringed instrument resembling the
<i>nablum</i>, p. 87. The next musician, also represented as a royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
personage, plays on a small species
of harp. Then follows a crowned
musician playing the viol which he
holds in almost precisely the same
manner as the violin is held. Again,
another, likewise crowned, plays
upon a harp, using with the right
hand a plectrum and with the left
hand merely his fingers. The last
two performers, apparently a gentleman
and a gentlewoman, are engaged
in striking the <i>tintinnabulum</i>,&mdash;a
set of bells in a frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i108" src="images/i108.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In this group of crowned minstrels
the sculptor has introduced a tumbler
standing on his head, perhaps
the vocalist of the company, as he
has no instrument to play upon.
Possibly the sculptor desired to symbolise
the hilarious effects which
music is capable of producing, as
well as its elevating influence upon
the devotional feelings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i109a" src="images/i109a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The two positions in which we
find the viol held is worthy of
notice, inasmuch as it refers the
inquirer further back than might be
expected for the origin of our
peculiar method of holding the
violin, and the violoncello, in
playing. There were several kinds
of the viol in use differing in size
and in compass of sound. The
most common number of strings was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
five, and it was tuned in various ways. One kind had a string
tuned to the note <img src="images/i109b.jpg" alt="" /> running at the side of the
finger-board instead of over it; this string was, therefore, only
capable of producing a single tone. The four other strings
were tuned thus: <img src="images/i109c.jpg" alt="" /> Two other species,
on which all the strings were placed over the finger-board,
were tuned: <img src="images/i109d.jpg" alt="" /> and:
<img src="images/i109e.jpg" alt="" /> The woodcut above represents a
very beautiful <i>vielle</i>; French, of about 1550, with monograms of
Henry II. This is at South Kensington.</p>

<p>The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually adopted
on other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat later
period than that of the <i>vielle</i>; for instance, on the <i>lira di braccio</i>
of the Italians. It was likewise adopted on the lute, to obtain a
fuller power in the bass; and hence arose the <i>theorbo</i>, the
<i>archlute</i>, and other varieties of the old lute.

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Orchestra, twelfth century, at Santiago.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p></div>

<p>A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on
the Portico della gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of Santiago
da Compostella, in Spain. This triple portal, which is
stated by an inscription on the lintel to have been executed in
the year 1188, consists of a large semicircular arch with a smaller
arch on either side. The central arch is filled by a tympanum,
round which are twenty-four life-sized seated figures, in high relief,
representing the twenty-four elders seen by St. John in the Apocalypse,
each with an instrument of music. These instruments
are carefully represented and are of great interest as showing
those in use in Spain at about the twelfth century. A cast of this
sculpture is in the Kensington museum.</p>

<p>In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the
reader will probably recognise several instruments in their hands,
which are identical with those already described in the preceding
pages. The <i>organistrum</i>, played by two persons, is placed in the
centre of the group, perhaps owing to its being the largest of the
instruments rather than that it was distinguished by any superiority
in sound or musical effect. Besides the small harp seen
in the hands of the eighth and nineteenth musicians (in form
nearly identical with the Anglo-saxon harp) we find a small triangular
harp, without a front-pillar, held on the lap by the fifth
and eighteenth musicians. The <i>salterio</i> on the lap of the tenth
and seventeenth musicians resembles the dulcimer, but seems
to be played with the fingers instead of with hammers. The
most interesting instrument in this orchestra is the <i>vihuela</i>, or
Spanish viol, of the twelfth century. The first, second, third, sixth,
seventh, ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a <i>vihuela</i> which bears a close
resemblance to the <i>rebec</i>. The instrument is represented with
three strings, although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs
are indicated. A large species of <i>vihuela</i> is given to the
eleventh, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians. This
instrument differs from the <i>rebec</i> in as far as its body is broader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and has incurvations at the sides. Also the sound-holes are
different in form and position. The bow does not occur with
any of these viols. But, as will be observed, the musicians are
not represented in the act of playing; they are tuning and preparing
for the performance, and the second of them is adjusting
the bridge of his instrument.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Front of the minstrels’ gallery, Exeter cathedral.</span> XIVth century.</p></div>

<p>The minstrels’ gallery of Exeter cathedral dates from the fourteenth
century. The front is divided into twelve niches, each of
which contains a winged figure or an angel playing on an instrument
of music. There is a cast also of this famous sculpture at South
Kensington. The instruments are so much dilapidated that some
of them cannot be clearly recognized; but, as far as may be ascertained,
they appear to be as follows:&mdash;1. The <i>cittern</i>. 2. The
<i>bagpipe</i>. 3. The <i>clarion</i>, a small trumpet having a shrill sound.
4. The <i>rebec</i>. 5. The <i>psaltery</i>. 6. The <i>syrinx</i>. 7. The <i>sackbut</i>.
8. The <i>regals</i>. 9. The <i>gittern</i>, a small guitar strung with catgut.
10. The <i>shalm</i>. 11. The <i>timbrel</i>; resembling our present tambourine,
with a double row of gingles. 12. <i>Cymbals.</i> Most of these
instruments have been already noticed in the preceding pages.
The <i>shalm</i>, or <i>shawm</i>, was a pipe with a reed in the mouth-hole.
The <i>wait</i> was an English wind instrument of the same construction.
If it differed in any respect from the <i>shalm</i>, the difference
consisted probably in the size only. The <i>wait</i> obtained its name
from being used principally by watchmen, or <i>waights</i>, to proclaim
the time of night. Such were the poor ancestors of our fine oboe
and clarinet.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Post-medi&aelig;val Musical Instruments.</span></h3>

<p>Attention must now be drawn to some instruments which
originated during the middle ages, but which attained their highest
popularity at a somewhat later period.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i114" src="images/i114.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Among the best known of these was the <i>virginal</i>, of
which we give an engraving from a specimen of the time of
Elizabeth at South Kensington. Another was the <i>lute</i>, which
about three hundred years
ago was almost as popular as
is at the present day the
pianoforte. Originally it
had eight thin catgut strings
arranged in four pairs, each
pair being tuned in unison;
so that its open strings produced
four tones; but in
the course of time more
strings were added. Until
the sixteenth century twelve was the largest number or, rather, six
pairs. Eleven appear for some centuries to have been the most
usual number of strings: these produced six tones, since they
were arranged in five pairs and a single string. The latter, called
the <i>chanterelle</i>, was the highest. According to Thomas Mace,
the English lute in common use during the seventeenth century
had twenty-four strings, arranged in twelve pairs, of which six
pairs ran over the finger-board and the other six by the side of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
it. This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a theorbo.
The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets consisting
of catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper distances
required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals. The
illustration on the next page represents a lute-player of the sixteenth
century. The frets are not indicated in the old engraving from which
the illustration has been taken. The order of tones adopted for the
open strings varied in different centuries and countries: and this
was also the case with the notation of lute music. The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the upper
line representing the first string; the second line, the second
string, &amp;c., and to mark with letters on the lines the frets at
which the fingers ought to be placed&mdash;<i>a</i> indicating the open
string, <i>b</i> the first fret, <i>c</i> the second fret, and so on.</p>

<p>The lute was made of various sizes according to the purpose
for which it was intended in performance. The treble-lute was of
the smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest. The
<i>theorbo</i>, or double-necked lute which appears to have come into
use during the sixteenth century, had in addition to the strings
situated over the finger-board a number of others running at the
left side of the finger-board which could not be shortened by the
fingers, and which produced the bass tones. The largest kinds of
theorbo were the <i>archlute</i> and the <i>chitarrone</i>.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of
some other instruments which have been popular during the last
three centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens
of many of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue
of that collection. It must suffice to refer the reader to
the illustrations there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord,
harpsichord, and other antiquated instruments much esteemed by
our forefathers.</p>

<p>Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to
know something about their quality of tone. “How do they
sound? Might they still be made effective in our present state of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the art?” are questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer
having such instruments brought before him. A few words
bearing on these questions may therefore not be out of place here.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i116" src="images/i116.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of
the art of music has greater progress been made since the last
century than in the construction of musical instruments. Nevertheless,
there are people who think that we have also lost something
here which might with advantage be restored. Our various instruments
by being more and more perfected are becoming too much
alike in quality of sound, or in that character of tone which the
French call <i>timbre</i>, and the Germans <i>Klangfarbe</i>, and which professor
Tyndall in his lectures on sound has translated <i>clang-tint</i>.
Every musical composer knows how much more suitable one <i>clang-tint</i>
is for the expression of a certain emotion than another. Our
old instruments, imperfect though they were in many respects,
possessed this variety of <i>clang-tint</i> to a high degree. Neither were
they on this account less capable of expression than the modern
ones. That no improvement has been made during the last two
centuries in instruments of the violin class is a well-known fact. As
to lutes and cithers the collection at Kensington contains specimens
so rich and mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret
that these instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.</p>

<p>As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments were
certainly superior to the modern. Indeed, we have now scarcely
a musical instrument which can be called beautiful. The
old lutes, spinets, viols, dulcimers, &amp;c., are not only elegant in
shape but are also often tastefully ornamented with carvings,
designs in marquetry, and painting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i118" src="images/i118.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The player on the <i>viola da gamba</i>, shown in the next engraving, is a
reduced copy of an illustration in “The Division Violist,” London,
1659. It shows exactly how the frets were regulated, and how the
bow was held. The most popular instruments played with a bow,
at that time, were the <i>treble-viol</i>, the <i>tenor-viol</i>, and the <i>bass-viol</i>.
It was usual for viol players to have “a chest of viols,” a case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
containing four or more viols, of different sizes. Thus, Thomas
Mace in his directions for the use of the viol, “Musick’s Monument”
1676, remarks, “Your best provision, and most complete,
will be a good chest of viols, six in number, viz., two basses, two
tenors, and two trebles, all truly and proportionably suited.” The
violist, to be properly furnished with his requirements, had therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
to supply himself with a larger stock of instruments than the
violinist of the present day.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i119" src="images/i119.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical instrument
called <i>recorder</i> is undoubtedly known to most readers from
the stage direction in Hamlet: <i>Re-enter players with recorders</i>.
But not many are likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has
now become very
scarce: we therefore
give an illustration
of this
old instrument,
which is copied
from “The Genteel
Companion;
Being exact Directions
for the
Recorder: etc.”
London, 1683.</p>

<p>The <i>bagpipe</i>
appears to have
been from time
immemorial a
special favourite
instrument with
the Celtic races;
but it was perhaps
quite as
much admired
by the Slavonic nations. In Poland, and in the Ukraine, it
used to be made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape
of the animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air,
appeared fully retained, exhibiting even the head with the horns;
hence the bagpipe was called <i>kosa</i>, which signifies a goat. The
woodcut p. 120 represents a Scotch bagpipe of the last century.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to
in Irish poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century. A
pig gravely engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in an
illuminated Irish manuscript, of the year 1300: and we give p. 121
a copy of a woodcut from “The Image
of Ireland,” a book printed in London
in 1581.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>The <i>bell</i> has always been so much in
popular favour in England that some
account of it must not be omitted.
Paul Hentzner a German, who visited
England in the year 1598, records
in his journal: “The people are vastly
fond of great noises that fill the ear,
such as the firing of cannon, drums,
and the ringing of bells; so that in
London it is common for a number
of them that have got a glass in their
heads to go up into some belfry, and
ring the bells for hours together for
the sake of exercise.” This may be
exaggeration,&mdash;not unusual with travellers.
It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing
has been a favourite amusement
with Englishmen for centuries.</p>

<p>The way in which church bells are
suspended and fastened, so as to permit
of their being made to vibrate in the most effective manner
without damaging by their vibration the building in
which they are placed, is in some countries very peculiar. The
Italian <i>campanile</i>, or tower of bells, is not unfrequently separated
from the church itself. In Servia the church bells are often hung
in a frame-work of timber built near the west end of the church.
In Zante and other islands of Greece the belfry is usually separate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
from the church. The reason assigned by the Greeks for having
adopted this plan is that in case of an earthquake the bells are
likely to fall and, were they placed in a tower, would destroy the
roof of the church and might cause the destruction of the whole
building. Also in Russia a special edifice for the bells is generally
separate from the church. In the Russian villages the
bells are not unfrequently hung in the branches of an oak-tree
near the church. In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the
lych-gate leading to the graveyard.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i122" src="images/i122.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument
such as the <i>carillon</i> is said by some to have suggested itself first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in Asiatic
countries sufficiently refutes this. Moreover, not only the Romans
employed variously arranged and attuned bells, but also among
the Etruscan antiquities an instrument has been discovered which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
is constructed of a number of bronze vessels placed in a row on a
metal rod. Numerous bells, varying in size and tone, have also
been found in Etruscan tombs. Among the later contrivances
of this kind in European countries the sets of bells suspended in
a wooden frame, which we find in medi&aelig;val illuminations, deserve
notice. In the British museum is a manuscript of the fourteenth
century in which king David is depicted holding in each hand a
hammer with which he strikes upon bells of different dimensions,
suspended on a wooden stand.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means
of bells merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date. In
Lancashire each of the ringers manages two bells, holding one
in either hand. Thus, an assemblage of seven ringers insures
fourteen different tones; and as each ringer may change his two
notes by substituting two other bells if required, even compositions
with various modulations, and of a somewhat intricate
character, may be executed,&mdash;provided the ringers are good
timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in with his
note, just as a member of the Russian horn band contributes his
single note whenever it occurs.</p>

<p>Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be
regarded as pre-eminently national to England. The bells constituting
a peal are frequently of the number of eight, attuned to
the diatonic scale. Also peals of ten bells, and even of twelve,
are occasionally formed. A peculiar feature of peal-ringing is
that the bells, which are provided with clappers, are generally
swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth completely upwards.
The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at Exeter cathedral:
another celebrated one is that of St. Margaret’s, Leicester, which
consists of ten bells. Peal-ringing is of an early date in England;
Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast about the
year 960 a set of six bells.</p>

<p>The <i>carillon</i> (engraved on the opposite page) is especially
popular in the Netherlands and Belgium, but is also found in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Germany, Italy, and some other European countries. It is generally
placed in the church tower and also sometimes in other
public edifices. The statement repeated by several writers that the
first carillon was invented in the year 1481 in the town of Alost is
not to be trusted, for the town of Bruges claims to have possessed
similar chimes in the year 1300. There are two kinds of carillons
in use on the continent, viz.: clock chimes, which are moved by
machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ; and such as are provided
with a set of keys, by means of which the tunes are played by a
musician. The carillon in the ‘Parochial-Kirche’ at Berlin, which
is one of the finest in Germany, contains thirty-seven bells; and is
provided with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal, which
together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of rather
more than three octaves. The keys of the manual are metal rods
somewhat above a foot in length; and are pressed down with the
palms of the hand. The keys of the pedal are of wood; the
instrument requires not only great dexterity but also a considerable
physical power. It is astonishing how rapidly passages can
be executed upon it by the player, who is generally the organist
of the church in which he acts as <i>carilloneur</i>. When engaged in
the last-named capacity he usually wears leathern gloves to protect
his fingers, as they are otherwise apt to become ill fit for
the more delicate treatment of the organ.</p>

<p>The want of a contrivance in the <i>carillon</i> for stopping the
vibration has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard near,
sound as a confused noise; only at some distance are they
tolerable. It must be remembered that the <i>carillon</i> is intended
especially to be heard from a distance. Successions of tones
which form a consonant chord, and which have some duration,
are evidently the most suitable for this instrument.</p>

<p>Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production of
some particular effects. The invention of a new instrument of
music has, therefore, not unfrequently led to the adoption of new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
effects in compositions. Take the pianoforte, which was invented
in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and which has now
obtained so great a popularity: its characteristics inspired our
great composers to the invention of effects, or expressions,
which cannot be properly rendered on any other instrument,
however superior in some respects it may be to the pianoforte.
Thus also the improvements which have been made during the
present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and
the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently
been not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in
our modern orchestral works.</p>

<p>Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced
the reader that a reference to the history of the music of
different nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own
musical instruments, which to the unprepared observer must
appear misty and impenetrable. In truth, it is with this study as
with any other scientific pursuit. The unassisted eye sees only
faint nebul&aelig; where with the aid of the telescope bright stars are
revealed.

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
